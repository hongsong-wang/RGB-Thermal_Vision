However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains, thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field.

While recent Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their inherent lack of spatial inductive bias causes attention to spread to irrelevant background regions, compromising crowd localization precision. Furthermore, effectively bridging the gap between these distinct modalities remains a major hurdle. To tackle this, we propose the Dual Modulation Framework, comprising two modules: Spatially Modulated Attention (SMA), which improves crowd localization by using a learnable Spatial Decay Mask to penalize attention between distant tokens and prevent focus from spreading to the background; and Adaptive Fusion Modulation (AFM), which implements a dynamic gating mechanism to prioritize the most reliable modality for adaptive cross-modal fusion. Extensive experiments on RGB-T crowd counting datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to previous works.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of LLM training across diverse real-world workloads and hardware platforms, including NVIDIA H100/H200 and AMD MI250 GPUs. We analyze dense and sparse models under various parallelism strategies -- tensor, pipeline, data, and expert -- and evaluate their effects on hardware utilization, power consumption, and thermal behavior. We further evaluate the effectiveness of optimizations such as activation recomputation and compute-communication overlap. Our findings show that performance is not determined solely by scaling hardware capacity. Scale-up systems with fewer, higher-memory GPUs can outperform scale-out systems in communication-bound regimes, but only under carefully tuned configurations; in other cases, scale-out deployments achieve superior throughput. We also show that certain parallelism combinations, such as tensor with pipeline, lead to bandwidth underutilization due to inefficient data chunking, while increasing microbatch sizes beyond a certain point induces bursty execution and peak power excursions that worsen thermal throttling. These insights reveal how training performance is shaped by complex interactions between hardware, system topology, and model execution. We conclude by offering recommendations for system and hardware design to improve the scalability and reliability of future LLM systems and workloads.

Prevailing models employ encoders pre-trained on RGB images to extract features from both RGB and infrared inputs, and design additional modules to achieve cross-modal feature fusion. This results in limited thermal feature extraction and suboptimal cross-modal fusion, while the redundant encoders further compromises the model's real-time efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose TUNI, with an RGB-T encoder consisting of multiple stacked blocks that simultaneously perform multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. By leveraging large-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data, the RGB-T encoder learns to integrate feature extraction and fusion in a unified manner. By slimming down the thermal branch, the encoder achieves a more compact architecture. Moreover, we introduce an RGB-T local module to strengthen the encoder's capacity for cross-modal local feature fusion. The RGB-T local module employs adaptive cosine similarity to selectively emphasize salient consistent and distinct local features across RGB-T modalities. Experimental results show that TUNI achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on FMB, PST900 and CART, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Meanwhile, it achieves an inference speed of 27 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX, demonstrating its real-time capability in deployment. Codes are available at https://github.com/xiaodonguo/TUNI.

In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures. However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge, our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale architectures under complex conditions.

Since the virtual element method allows the use of arbitrary polygonal elements, the inherent mesh flexibility of VEM allows localized mesh modifications without affecting global mesh structure, making it particularly effective for the analysis of electronic packaging reliability involving complex geometries and multiple geometric scales. The approach implements a novel non-matching mesh generation strategy that strategically combines polygonal meshes for complex small-scale regions with regular quadrilateral meshes for larger domains. The VEM formulation addresses both heat conduction and thermomechanical coupling problems, with comprehensive verification through analytical benchmarks and practical electronic packaging case studies, including Through-Silicon Via (TSV), Ball Grid Array (BGA), and Plastic Ball Grid Array (PBGA) structures. Results demonstrate that the method accurately captures stress concentrations at material interfaces and provides reliable thermal and mechanical response predictions.

Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity, normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33 ground-based sensors.

However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion.

Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge, significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials, we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario, further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface. Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency.

It is designed to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically, our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker} achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance.

While State-Space Models like Mamba offer proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent 1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images, hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations, our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new paradigm for infrared image restoration.

Most RGBT tasks follow a case-by-case research paradigm, relying on manually customized models to learn task-oriented representations. Nevertheless, this paradigm is inherently constrained by artificial inductive bias, modality bias, and data bottleneck. To address these limitations, we make the initial attempt to build a Generalized RGBT MultiSpectral foundation model (M-SpecGene), which aims to learn modality-invariant representations from large-scale broad data in a self-supervised manner. M-SpecGene provides new insights into multispectral fusion and integrates prior case-by-case studies into a unified paradigm. Considering the unique characteristic of information imbalance in RGBT data, we introduce the Cross-Modality Structural Sparsity (CMSS) metric to quantify the information density across two modalities. Then we develop the GMM-CMSS progressive masking strategy to facilitate a flexible, easy-to-hard, and object-centric pre-training process. Comprehensive experiments validate M-SpecGene's generalizability across eleven datasets for four RGBT downstream tasks. The code will be available at https://github.com/CalayZhou/M-SpecGene.

Addressing these issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its generality.

However, the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the importance of replicating aerial viewing angles.

However, existing approaches often struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency, spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event tracking.

However, they still underutilize two essentials: modality-specific frequency structure and long-range temporal dependencies. We present Learning Frequency and Memory-Aware Prompts, a dual-adapter framework that injects lightweight prompts into a frozen RGB tracker. A frequency-guided visual adapter adaptively transfers complementary cues across modalities by jointly calibrating spatial, channel, and frequency components, narrowing the modality gap without full fine-tuning. A multilevel memory adapter with short, long, and permanent memory stores, updates, and retrieves reliable temporal context, enabling consistent propagation across frames and robust recovery from occlusion, motion blur, and illumination changes. This unified design preserves the efficiency of prompt learning while strengthening cross-modal interaction and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event benchmarks show consistent state-of-the-art results over fully fine-tuned and adapter-based baselines, together with favorable parameter efficiency and runtime.

Nevertheless, multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal 2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution. Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Further experiments on the PST900 dataset demonstrate its generalizability. Codes are available at https://github.com/xiaodonguo/CMSSM.

Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

Given two images from different visual modalities, such as an RGB image and a depth map, our model identifies which pairs of pixels correspond to the same physical points in the scene. To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.

Existing methods often employ two parallel branches to separately process the RGB and X input streams, requiring the model to simultaneously handle two dispersed feature spaces, which complicates both the model structure and computation process. More critically, intra-modality spatial modeling within each dispersed space incurs substantial computational overhead, limiting resources for inter-modality spatial modeling and temporal modeling. To address this, we propose a novel tracker, CSTrack, which focuses on modeling Compact Spatiotemporal features to achieve simple yet effective tracking. Specifically, we first introduce an innovative Spatial Compact Module that integrates the RGB-X dual input streams into a compact spatial feature, enabling thorough intra- and inter-modality spatial modeling. Additionally, we design an efficient Temporal Compact Module that compactly represents temporal features by constructing the refined target distribution heatmap. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our compact spatiotemporal modeling method, with CSTrack achieving new SOTA results on mainstream RGB-X benchmarks.

This goal is challenging because low-cost IMUs and barometers have significant bias, and anemometer measurements are very susceptible to interference from spinning propellers and ground effects. We employ a GRU-based deep neural network to estimate relative air speed from noisy and disturbed anemometer measurements, and an observer with bias model to fuse the sensor data and thus estimate the state of aerial vehicle. A complete flight data, including takeoff and landing on the ground, shows that the approach is able to decouple the downwash induced wind speed caused by propellers and the ground effect, and accurately estimate the flight speed in a wind-free indoor environment. IMU, and barometer bias are effectively estimated, which significantly reduces the position integration drift, which is only 5.7m for 203s manual random flight.

Consequently, object detection based on EVS has attracted increasing attention from researchers. Current event stream object detection algorithms are typically built upon Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers, which either capture limited local features using convolutional filters or incur high computational costs due to the utilization of self-attention. Recently proposed vision heat conduction backbone networks have shown a good balance between efficiency and accuracy; however, these models are not specifically designed for event stream data. They exhibit weak capability in modeling object contour information and fail to exploit the benefits of multi-scale features. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel dynamic graph induced contour-aware heat conduction network for event stream based object detection, termed CvHeat-DET. The proposed model effectively leverages the clear contour information inherent in event streams to predict the thermal diffusivity coefficients within the heat conduction model, and integrates hierarchical structural graph features to enhance feature learning across multiple scales. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets for event stream-based object detection fully validated the effectiveness of the proposed model.

However, these systems often overlook the needs of people with mobility restrictions. Moreover, the use of RGB cameras presents significant challenges, including limited detection performance under adverse weather or low-visibility conditions, as well as heightened privacy concerns. To address these issues, we propose a fully automated, thermal detector-based traffic light system that dynamically adjusts signal durations for individuals with walking impairments or mobility burden and triggers the auditory signal for visually impaired individuals, thereby advancing towards barrier-free intersection for all users. To this end, we build the thermal dataset for people with mobility restrictions (TD4PWMR), designed to capture diverse pedestrian scenarios, particularly focusing on individuals with mobility aids or mobility burden under varying environmental conditions, such as different lighting, weather, and crowded urban settings. While thermal imaging offers advantages in terms of privacy and robustness to adverse conditions, it also introduces inherent hurdles for object detection due to its lack of color and fine texture details and generally lower resolution of thermal images. To overcome these limitations, we develop YOLO-Thermal, a novel variant of the YOLO architecture that integrates advanced feature extraction and attention mechanisms for enhanced detection accuracy and robustness in thermal imaging. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed thermal detector outperforms existing detectors, while the proposed traffic light system effectively enhances barrier-free intersection.

However, the omission of the object region by erroneous pseudo-label or the introduction of background noise affects the efficiency of modality fusion, while pseudo-label noise triggered by similar object noise can further affect the tracking performance. In this paper, we propose GDSTrack, a novel approach that introduces dynamic graph fusion and temporal diffusion to address the above challenges in self-supervised RGB-T tracking. GDSTrack dynamically fuses the modalities of neighboring frames, treats them as distractor noise, and leverages the denoising capability of a generative model. Specifically, by constructing an adjacency matrix via an Adjacency Matrix Generator (AMG), the proposed Modality-guided Dynamic Graph Fusion (MDGF) module uses a dynamic adjacency matrix to guide graph attention, focusing on and fusing the object's coherent regions. Temporal Graph-Informed Diffusion (TGID) models MDGF features from neighboring frames as interference, and thus improving robustness against similar-object noise. Extensive experiments conducted on four public RGB-T tracking datasets demonstrate that GDSTrack outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, designing such a sensor suite involves multiple critical design decisions, such as sensor selection, component placement, thermal and power limitations, compute requirements, networking, synchronization, and calibration. While the importance of these key aspects is widely recognized, they are often overlooked in academia or retained as proprietary knowledge within large corporations. To improve this situation, we present Boxi, a tightly integrated sensor payload that enables robust autonomy of robots in the wild. This paper discusses the impact of payload design decisions made to optimize algorithmic performance for downstream tasks, specifically focusing on state estimation and mapping. Boxi is equipped with a variety of sensors: two LiDARs, 10 RGB cameras including high-dynamic range, global shutter, and rolling shutter models, an RGB-D camera, 7 inertial measurement units (IMUs) of varying precision, and a dual antenna RTK GNSS system. Our analysis shows that time synchronization, calibration, and sensor modality have a crucial impact on the state estimation performance. We frame this analysis in the context of cost considerations and environment-specific challenges. We also present a mobile sensor suite `cookbook` to serve as a comprehensive guideline, highlighting generalizable key design considerations and lessons learned during the development of Boxi. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of Boxi being used in a variety of applications in real-world scenarios, contributing to robust autonomy.

The limited availability of labeled thermal data constrains the generalization capabilities of thermal MDE models compared to foundational RGB MDE models, which benefit from datasets of millions of images across diverse scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel pipeline that enhances thermal MDE through knowledge distillation from a versatile RGB MDE model. Our approach features a confidence-aware distillation method that utilizes the predicted confidence of the RGB MDE to selectively strengthen the thermal MDE model, capitalizing on the strengths of the RGB model while mitigating its weaknesses. Our method significantly improves the accuracy of the thermal MDE, independent of the availability of labeled depth supervision, and greatly expands its applicability to new scenarios. In our experiments on new scenarios without labeled depth, the proposed confidence-aware distillation method reduces the absolute relative error of thermal MDE by 22.88\% compared to the baseline without distillation.

However, inherent limitations of IR images, such as the lack of color and texture cues, pose challenges for RGB-trained models, leading to increased false positives and poor-quality pseudo-labels. To address this, we propose Semantic-Aware Gray color Augmentation (SAGA), a novel strategy for mitigating color bias and bridging the domain gap by extracting object-level features relevant to IR images. Additionally, to validate the proposed SAGA for drone imagery, we introduce the IndraEye, a multi-sensor (RGB-IR) dataset designed for diverse applications. The dataset contains 5,612 images with 145,666 instances, captured from diverse angles, altitudes, backgrounds, and times of day, offering valuable opportunities for multimodal learning, domain adaptation for object detection and segmentation, and exploration of sensor-specific strengths and weaknesses. IndraEye aims to enhance the development of more robust and accurate aerial perception systems, especially in challenging environments. Experimental results show that SAGA significantly improves RGB-to-IR adaptation for autonomous driving and IndraEye dataset, achieving consistent performance gains of +0.4% to +7.6% (mAP) when integrated with state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

Existing methods generate or enhance missing details in low-quality spectra data using the high-quality one, generally called the primary spectrum, but how to justify the primary spectrum is a challenging problem. In addition, when the quality of the primary spectrum is low, the enhancement effect would be greatly degraded, thus limiting the performance of multi-spectral vehicle ReID. To address these problems, we propose the Collaborative Enhancement Network (CoEN), which generates a high-quality proxy from all spectra data and leverages it to supervise the selection of primary spectrum and enhance all spectra features in a collaborative manner, for robust multi-spectral vehicle ReID. First, to integrate the rich cues from all spectra data, we design the Proxy Generator (PG) to progressively aggregate multi-spectral features. Second, we design the Dynamic Quality Sort Module (DQSM), which sorts all spectra data by measuring their correlations with the proxy, to accurately select the primary spectra with the highest correlation. Finally, we design the Collaborative Enhancement Module (CEM) to effectively compensate for missing contents of all spectra by collaborating the primary spectra and the proxy, thereby mitigating the impact of low-quality primary spectra.

However, the inherent low resolution of thermal sensors leads to insufficient details and blurred boundaries. Super-resolution (SR) offers a promising solution to address this issue, while most existing SR methods are designed for fixed-scale SR. They are computationally expensive and inflexible in practical applications. To address above issues, this work proposes a novel any-scale thermal SR method (AnyTSR) for UAV within a single model. Specifically, a new image encoder is proposed to explicitly assign specific feature code to enable more accurate and flexible representation. Additionally, by effectively embedding coordinate offset information into the local feature ensemble, an innovative any-scale upsampler is proposed to better understand spatial relationships and reduce artifacts. Moreover, a novel dataset (UAV-TSR), covering both land and water scenes, is constructed for thermal SR tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all scaling factors as well as generates more accurate and detailed high-resolution images.

Leveraging a lightweight yet powerful backbone, ThermoStereoRT constructs a 3D cost volume from thermal images and employs multi-scale attention mechanisms to produce an initial disparity map. To refine this map, we design a novel channel and spatial attention module. Addressing the challenge of sparse ground truth data in thermal imagery, we utilize knowledge distillation to boost performance without increasing computational demands.

However, the challenging factors in real-world scenarios, such as insufficient lighting and rapid movements, inevitably degrade the performance of RGB cameras. To address these challenges, biologically inspired event cameras offer a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional RGB cameras. In this work, we rethink human activity recognition by combining the RGB and event cameras. The first contribution is the proposed large-scale multi-modal RGB-Event human activity recognition benchmark dataset, termed HARDVS 2.0, which bridges the dataset gaps. It contains 300 categories of everyday real-world actions with a total of 107,646 paired videos covering various challenging scenarios. Inspired by the physics-informed heat conduction model, we propose a novel multi-modal heat conduction operation framework for effective activity recognition, termed MMHCO-HAR. More in detail, given the RGB frames and event streams, we first extract the feature embeddings using a stem network. Then, multi-modal Heat Conduction blocks are designed to fuse the dual features, the key module of which is the multi-modal Heat Conduction Operation layer. We integrate RGB and event embeddings through a multi-modal DCT-IDCT layer while adaptively incorporating the thermal conductivity coefficient via FVEs into this module. After that, we propose an adaptive fusion module based on a policy routing strategy for high-performance classification. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently performs well, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

Detecting UAV targets under nonuniform conditions is crucial in UAV surveillance applications. Existing methods typically treat infrared nonuniformity correction (NUC) as a preprocessing step for detection, which leads to suboptimal performance. Balancing the two tasks while enhancing detection beneficial information remains challenging. In this paper, we present a detection-friendly union framework, termed UniCD, that simultaneously addresses both infrared NUC and UAV target detection tasks in an end-to-end manner. We first model NUC as a small number of parameter estimation problem jointly driven by priors and data to generate detection-conducive images. Then, we incorporate a new auxiliary loss with target mask supervision into the backbone of the infrared UAV target detection network to strengthen target features while suppressing the background. To better balance correction and detection, we introduce a detection-guided self-supervised loss to reduce feature discrepancies between the two tasks, thereby enhancing detection robustness to varying nonuniformity levels. Additionally, we construct a new benchmark composed of 50,000 infrared images in various nonuniformity types, multi-scale UAV targets and rich backgrounds with target annotations, called IRBFD. Extensive experiments on IRBFD demonstrate that our UniCD is a robust union framework for NUC and UAV target detection while achieving real-time processing capabilities.

However, collecting large thermal datasets is costly and labor-intensive due to the specialized equipment required for infrared image capture. To address this challenge, researchers have explored visible-to-thermal image translation. Most existing methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Diffusion Models (DMs), treating the task as a style transfer problem. As a result, these approaches attempt to learn both the modality distribution shift and underlying physical principles from limited training data. In this paper, we propose F-ViTA, a novel approach that leverages the general world knowledge embedded in foundation models to guide the diffusion process for improved translation. Specifically, we condition an InstructPix2Pix Diffusion Model with zero-shot masks and labels from foundation models such as SAM and Grounded DINO. This allows the model to learn meaningful correlations between scene objects and their thermal signatures in infrared imagery. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that F-ViTA outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, our model generalizes well to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and can generate Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR), Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR), and Near-Infrared (NIR) translations from the same visible image.

However, existing perception algorithms relying on the visible spectrum are highly affected by weather and lighting conditions. A long-wave infrared camera (i.e., thermal imaging camera) can be a potential solution to achieve high-level robustness. However, the absence of large-scale datasets and standardized benchmarks remains a significant bottleneck to progress in active research for robust visual perception from thermal images. To this end, this manuscript provides a large-scale Multi-Spectral Stereo (MS$^2$) dataset that consists of stereo RGB, stereo NIR, stereo thermal, stereo LiDAR data, and GNSS/IMU information along with semi-dense depth ground truth. MS$^2$ dataset includes 162K synchronized multi-modal data pairs captured across diverse locations (e.g., urban city, residential area, campus, and high-way road) at different times (e.g., morning, daytime, and nighttime) and under various weather conditions (e.g., clear-sky, cloudy, and rainy). Secondly, we conduct a thorough evaluation of monocular and stereo depth estimation networks across RGB, NIR, and thermal modalities to establish standardized benchmark results on MS$^2$ depth test sets (e.g., day, night, and rainy). Lastly, we provide in-depth analyses and discuss the challenges revealed by the benchmark results, such as the performance variability for each modality under adverse conditions, domain shift between different sensor modalities, and potential research direction for thermal perception.

This paper provides a straightforward approach to address multi-UAV tracking in thermal infrared video, leveraging recent advances in detection and tracking.

We evaluate our approach following the 4th Anti-UAV Challenge metrics and reach competitive performance. Notably, we achieved strong results without using contrast enhancement or temporal information fusion to enrich UAV features, highlighting our approach as a "Strong Baseline" for multi-UAV tracking tasks.

Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), trained on large datasets, demonstrates strong perception potential in perception tasks, its inherent training paradigm prevents it from being suitable for RGB-T tasks. To address these challenges, we propose SHIFNet, a novel SAM2-driven Hybrid Interaction Paradigm that unlocks the potential of SAM2 with linguistic guidance for efficient RGB-Thermal perception. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware Cross-modal Fusion (SACF) module that dynamically balances modality contributions through text-guided affinity learning, overcoming SAM2's inherent RGB bias; (2) Heterogeneous Prompting Decoder (HPD) that enhances global semantic information through a semantic enhancement module and then combined with category embeddings to amplify cross-modal semantic consistency. With 32.27M trainable parameters, SHIFNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on public benchmarks, reaching 89.8% on PST900 and 67.8% on FMB, respectively. The framework facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained large models to RGB-T segmentation tasks, effectively mitigating the high costs associated with data collection while endowing robotic systems with comprehensive perception capabilities.

Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. However, this is often inadequately addressed by existing generative models, making the consistent generation of stable and symmetrically valid crystal structures a significant challenge. We introduce WyFormer, a generative model that directly tackles this by formally conditioning on space group symmetry. It achieves this by using Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer encoder and an absence of positional encoding. Extensive experimentation demonstrates WyFormer's compelling combination of attributes: it achieves best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, incorporates a physics-motivated inductive bias, produces structures with competitive stability, predicts material properties with competitive accuracy even without atomic coordinates, and exhibits unparalleled inference speed.

In this work, we develop a general neural network potential (NNP) that efficiently predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs composed of C, H, N, and O. Our framework leverages pre-trained NNP models, fine-tuned using transfer learning on energy and force data derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This strategy enables rapid adaptation across 20 different HEM systems while maintaining DFT-level accuracy, significantly reducing computational costs. A key aspect of this work is the ability of NNP model to capture the chemical activity space of HEMs, accurately describe the key atomic interactions and reaction mechanisms during thermal decomposition. The general NNP model has been applied in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and validated with experimental data for various HEM structures. Results show that the NNP model accurately predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs by effectively describing their chemical activity space. Compared to traditional force fields, it offers superior DFT-level accuracy and generalization across both microscopic and macroscopic properties, reducing the computational and experimental costs. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design and development of HEMs and proposes a promising framework for integrating DFT, machine learning, and experimental methods in materials research.

Despite its popularity, the limitations of infrared cameras, such as low spatial resolution and complex degradations, consistently challenge imaging quality and subsequent visual tasks. Hence, infrared image super-resolution (IISR) has been developed to address this challenge. While recent developments in diffusion models have greatly advanced this field, current methods to solve it either ignore the unique modal characteristics of infrared imaging or overlook the machine perception requirements. To bridge these gaps, we propose DifIISR, an infrared image super-resolution diffusion model optimized for visual quality and perceptual performance. Our approach achieves task-based guidance for diffusion by injecting gradients derived from visual and perceptual priors into the noise during the reverse process. Specifically, we introduce an infrared thermal spectrum distribution regulation to preserve visual fidelity, ensuring that the reconstructed infrared images closely align with high-resolution images by matching their frequency components. Subsequently, we incorporate various visual foundational models as the perceptual guidance for downstream visual tasks, infusing generalizable perceptual features beneficial for detection and segmentation. As a result, our approach gains superior visual results while attaining State-Of-The-Art downstream task performance. Code is available at https://github.com/zirui0625/DifIISR

The scarcity of high-quality infrared data, coupled with the challenges of dynamic, intricate degradations, makes it difficult to recover details using existing methods. In this paper, we introduce thermal degradation simulation integrated into the training process via a mini-max optimization, by modeling these degraded factors as adversarial attacks on thermal images. The simulation is dynamic to maximize objective functions, thus capturing a broad spectrum of degraded data distributions. This approach enables training with limited data, thereby improving model performance.Additionally, we introduce a dual-interaction network that combines the benefits of spiking neural networks with scale transformation to capture degraded features with sharp spike signal intensities. This architecture ensures compact model parameters while preserving efficient feature representation.

For this purpose, many autonomous vehicles employ multi-modal sensor systems, including an RGB camera, NIR camera, thermal camera, LiDAR, or Radar. They mainly adopt two strategies to use multiple sensors: modality-wise and multi-modal fused inference. The former method is flexible but memory-inefficient, unreliable, and vulnerable. Multi-modal fusion can provide high-level reliability, yet it needs a specialized architecture. In this paper, we propose an effective solution, named align-and-fuse strategy, for the depth estimation from multi-spectral images. In the align stage, we align embedding spaces between multiple spectrum bands to learn shareable representation across multi-spectral images by minimizing contrastive loss of global and spatially aligned local features with geometry cue. After that, in the fuse stage, we train an attachable feature fusion module that can selectively aggregate the multi-spectral features for reliable and robust prediction results. Based on the proposed method, a single-depth network can achieve both spectral-invariant and multi-spectral fused depth estimation while preserving reliability, memory efficiency, and flexibility.

However, existing unified RGB-X trackers (X represents depth, event, or thermal modality) either rely on the task-specific training strategy for individual RGB-X image pairs or fail to address the critical importance of modality-adaptive perception in real-world applications. In this work, we propose UASTrack, a unified adaptive selection framework that facilitates both model and parameter unification, as well as adaptive modality discrimination across various multi-modal tracking tasks. To achieve modality-adaptive perception in joint RGB-X pairs, we design a Discriminative Auto-Selector (DAS) capable of identifying modality labels, thereby distinguishing the data distributions of auxiliary modalities. Furthermore, we propose a Task-Customized Optimization Adapter (TCOA) tailored to various modalities in the latent space. This strategy effectively filters noise redundancy and mitigates background interference based on the specific characteristics of each modality. Extensive comparisons conducted on five benchmarks including LasHeR, GTOT, RGBT234, VisEvent, and DepthTrack, covering RGB-T, RGB-E, and RGB-D tracking scenarios, demonstrate our innovative approach achieves comparative performance by introducing only additional training parameters of 1.87M and flops of 1.95G.

The design of TAPOR, however, is challenging, mainly because the captured temperature maps are low-resolution and textureless. To overcome the challenges, we investigate thermo-depth and thermo-pose properties, proposing a novel physics-inspired neural network that learns effective 3D spatial representations of potential hand poses. We then formulate the 3D pose reconstruction problem as a distinct retrieval task, enabling accurate hand pose determination from the input temperature map. To deploy TAPOR on IoT devices, we introduce an effective heterogeneous knowledge distillation method, reducing computation by 377x. TAPOR is fully implemented and tested in real-world scenarios, showing remarkable performance, supported by four gesture control and finger tracking case studies. We envision TAPOR to be a ubiquitous interface for around-device control and have open-sourced it at https://github.com/aiot-lab/TAPOR.

However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems ($N>12$, where $N$ is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of CNOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems $N\geq12$ compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work advances a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for quantum gravity studies and out-of-time-ordered thermal correlators computation in quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware.

While existing deep learning-based methods can achieve good detection results, they generally necessitate pixel-level annotations, which are notably challenging to acquire for hyperspectral images. To address this issue, we introduce point supervision into HSOD, and incorporate Spectral Saliency, derived from conventional HSOD methods, as a pivotal spectral representation within the framework. This integration leads to the development of a novel Spectrum-oriented Point-supervised Saliency Detector (SPSD). Specifically, we propose a novel pipeline, specifically designed for HSIs, to generate pseudo-labels, effectively mitigating the performance decline associated with point supervision strategy. Additionally, Spectral Saliency is employed to counteract information loss during model supervision and saliency refinement, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and edge accuracy of the detected objects. Furthermore, we introduce a Spectrum-transformed Spatial Gate to focus more precisely on salient regions while reducing feature redundancy. We have carried out comprehensive experiments on both HSOD-BIT and HS-SOD datasets to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, using mean absolute error (MAE), E-measure, F-measure, Area Under Curve, and Cross Correlation as evaluation metrics. For instance, on the HSOD-BIT dataset, our SPSD achieves a MAE of 0.031 and an F-measure of 0.878. Thorough ablation studies have substantiated the effectiveness of each individual module and provided insights into the model's working mechanism. Further evaluations on RGB-thermal salient object detection datasets highlight the versatility of our approach.

In this paper, we construct a large-scale and high-diversity unaligned RGB-T SOD dataset named UVT20K, comprising 20,000 image pairs, 407 scenes, and 1256 object categories. All samples are collected from real-world scenarios with various challenges, such as low illumination, image clutter, complex salient objects, and so on. To support the exploration for further research, each sample in UVT20K is annotated with a comprehensive set of ground truths, including saliency masks, scribbles, boundaries, and challenge attributes. In addition, we propose a Progressive Correlation Network (PCNet), which models inter- and intra-modal correlations on the basis of explicit alignment to achieve accurate predictions in unaligned image pairs.

Existing multi-object tracking algorithms generally focus on single-modality scenes, and overlook the complementary characteristics of tiny objects captured by multiple remote sensors. To enhance tracking performance by integrating complementary information from multiple sources, we propose a novel framework called {HGT-Track (Heterogeneous Graph Transformer based Multi-Tiny-Object Tracking)}. Specifically, we first employ a Transformer-based encoder to embed images from different modalities. Subsequently, we utilize Heterogeneous Graph Transformer to aggregate spatial and temporal information from multiple modalities to generate detection and tracking features. Additionally, we introduce a target re-detection module (ReDet) to ensure tracklet continuity by maintaining consistency across different modalities. Furthermore, this paper introduces the first benchmark VT-Tiny-MOT (Visible-Thermal Tiny Multi-Object Tracking) for RGB-T fused multiple tiny object tracking. Extensive experiments are conducted on VT-Tiny-MOT, and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance in terms of MOTA (Multiple-Object Tracking Accuracy) and ID-F1 score.

Previous studies use numerical solvers or ML-based surrogate models for these simulations. However, multiphysics simulations typically require integrating multiple specialized solvers-each for a specific physical process-into a coupled program, which introduces significant development challenges. Furthermore, existing numerical algorithms struggle with highly complex large-scale structures in multi-component simulations. Here we propose compositional Multiphysics and Multi-component PDE Simulation with Diffusion models (M2PDE) to overcome these challenges. During diffusion-based training, M2PDE learns energy functions modeling the conditional probability of one physical process/component conditioned on other processes/components. In inference, M2PDE generates coupled multiphysics and multi-component solutions by sampling from the joint probability distribution. We evaluate M2PDE on two multiphysics tasks-reaction-diffusion and nuclear thermal coupling-where it achieves more accurate predictions than surrogate models in challenging scenarios. We then apply it to a multi-component prismatic fuel element problem, demonstrating that M2PDE scales from single-component training to a 64-component structure and outperforms existing domain-decomposition and graph-based approaches.

However, existing deep learning-based RGB-T SOD models suffer from two major limitations. First, Transformer-based models with quadratic complexity are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting their application in high-resolution bi-modal feature fusion. Second, even when these models converge to an optimal solution, there remains a frequency gap between the prediction and ground-truth. To overcome these limitations, we propose a purely Fourier transform-based model, namely Deep Fourier-Embedded Network (DFENet), for accurate RGB-T SOD. To address the computational complexity when dealing with high-resolution images, we leverage the efficiency of fast Fourier transform with linear complexity to design three key components: (1) the Modal-coordinated Perception Attention, which fuses RGB and thermal modalities with enhanced multi-dimensional representation; (2) the Frequency-decomposed Edge-aware Block, which clarifies object edges by deeply decomposing and enhancing frequency components of low-level features; and (3) the Fourier Residual Channel Attention Block, which prioritizes high-frequency information while aligning channel-wise global relationships. To mitigate the frequency gap, we propose Co-focus Frequency Loss, which dynamically weights hard frequencies during edge frequency reconstruction by cross-referencing bi-modal edge information in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on four RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets demonstrate that DFENet outperforms fifteen existing state-of-the-art RGB-T SOD models. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the value and effectiveness of our newly proposed components. The code is available at https://github.com/JoshuaLPF/DFENet.

Current approaches to address SR tasks, such as transformer-based and diffusion-based methods, are either dedicated to extracting RGB image features or assuming similar degradation patterns, neglecting the inherent modal disparities between infrared and visible images. When directly applied to infrared image SR tasks, these methods inevitably distort the infrared spectral distribution, compromising the machine perception in downstream tasks. In this work, we emphasize the infrared spectral distribution fidelity and propose a Contourlet refinement gate framework to restore infrared modal-specific features while preserving spectral distribution fidelity. Our approach captures high-pass subbands from multi-scale and multi-directional infrared spectral decomposition to recover infrared-degraded information through a gate architecture. The proposed Spectral Fidelity Loss regularizes the spectral frequency distribution during reconstruction, which ensures the preservation of both high- and low-frequency components and maintains the fidelity of infrared-specific features. We propose a two-stage prompt-learning optimization to guide the model in learning infrared HR characteristics from LR degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing image SR models in both visual and perceptual tasks while notably enhancing machine perception in downstream tasks.

Current state-of-the-art methods are typically specialized for a single spectral difference, such as visibleinfrared, and struggle to adapt to other modalities due to their reliance on expensive supervision, such as depth maps or camera poses. To address the need for rapid adaptation across modalities, we introduce XPoint, a self-supervised, modular image-matching framework designed for adaptive training and fine-tuning on aligned multispectral datasets, allowing users to customize key components based on their specific tasks. XPoint employs modularity and self-supervision to allow for the adjustment of elements such as the base detector, which generates pseudoground truth keypoints invariant to viewpoint and spectrum variations. The framework integrates a VMamba encoder, pretrained on segmentation tasks, for robust feature extraction, and includes three joint decoder heads: two are dedicated to interest point and descriptor extraction; and a task-specific homography regression head imposes geometric constraints for superior performance in tasks like image registration. This flexible architecture enables quick adaptation to a wide range of modalities, demonstrated by training on Optical-Thermal data and fine-tuning on settings such as visual-near infrared, visual-infrared, visual-longwave infrared, and visual-synthetic aperture radar. Experimental results show that XPoint consistently outperforms or matches state-ofthe-art methods in feature matching and image registration tasks across five distinct multispectral datasets.

However, the high computational expense of existing UAV-based BSOD models limits their applicability to real-world UAV devices. To address this problem, we propose an efficient Fourier filter network with contrastive learning that achieves both real-time and accurate performance. Specifically, we first design a semantic contrastive alignment loss to align the two modalities at the semantic level, which facilitates mutual refinement in a parameter-free way. Second, inspired by the fast Fourier transform that obtains global relevance in linear complexity, we propose synchronized alignment fusion, which aligns and fuses bi-modal features in the channel and spatial dimensions by a hierarchical filtering mechanism. Our proposed model, AlignSal, reduces the number of parameters by 70.0%, decreases the floating point operations by 49.4%, and increases the inference speed by 152.5% compared to the cutting-edge BSOD model (i.e., MROS). Extensive experiments on the UAV RGB-T 2400 and seven bi-modal dense prediction datasets demonstrate that AlignSal achieves both real-time inference speed and better performance and generalizability compared to nineteen state-of-the-art models across most evaluation metrics. In addition, our ablation studies further verify AlignSal's potential in boosting the performance of existing aligned BSOD models on UAV-based unaligned data.

Existing methods often employ single guidance model to generate the guidance features from optical images to assist thermal UAV images super-resolution. However, single guidance models make it difficult to generate effective guidance features under favorable and adverse conditions in UAV scenarios, thus limiting the performance of OTUAV-SR. To address this issue, we propose a novel Guidance Disentanglement network (GDNet), which disentangles the optical image representation according to typical UAV scenario attributes to form guidance features under both favorable and adverse conditions, for robust OTUAV-SR. Moreover, we design an attribute-aware fusion module to combine all attribute-based optical guidance features, which could form a more discriminative representation and fit the attribute-agnostic guidance process. To facilitate OTUAV-SR research in complex UAV scenarios, we introduce VGTSR2.0, a large-scale benchmark dataset containing 3,500 aligned optical-thermal image pairs captured under diverse conditions and scenes. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 demonstrate that GDNet significantly improves OTUAV-SR performance over state-of-the-art methods, especially in the challenging low-light and foggy environments commonly encountered in UAV scenarios.

In this paper, we present Thermal Chameleon Network (TCNet), a task-adaptive tone-mapping approach for RAW 14-bit TIR images. Given the same image, TCNet tone-maps different representations of TIR images tailored for each specific task, eliminating the heuristic image rescaling preprocessing and reliance on the extensive prior knowledge of the scene temperature or task-specific characteristics.

Most existing methods focus on cross-modal fusion involving two modalities, often overlooking more complex multi-modal fusion, which is essential for real-world applications like autonomous driving, where visible, depth, event, LiDAR, etc., are used. Besides, few attempts for multi-modal fusion, \emph{e.g.}, simple concatenation, cross-modal attention, and token selection, cannot well dig into the intrinsic shared and specific details of multiple modalities. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, we propose a Part-Whole Relational Fusion (PWRF) framework. For the first time, this framework treats multi-modal fusion as part-whole relational fusion. It routes multiple individual part-level modalities to a fused whole-level modality using the part-whole relational routing ability of Capsule Networks (CapsNets). Through this part-whole routing, our PWRF generates modal-shared and modal-specific semantics from the whole-level modal capsules and the routing coefficients, respectively. On top of that, modal-shared and modal-specific details can be employed to solve the issue of multi-modal scene understanding, including synthetic multi-modal segmentation and visible-depth-thermal salient object detection in this paper. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PWRF framework for multi-modal scene understanding.

It can be observed that modality gap mainly lies in the image style difference. In this work, we propose a novel Coupled Knowledge Distillation framework called CKD, which pursues common styles of different modalities to break modality gap, for high performance RGBT tracking. In particular, we introduce two student networks and employ the style distillation loss to make their style features consistent as much as possible. Through alleviating the style difference of two student networks, we can break modality gap of different modalities well. However, the distillation of style features might harm to the content representations of two modalities in student networks. To handle this issue, we take original RGB and TIR networks as the teachers, and distill their content knowledge into two student networks respectively by the style-content orthogonal feature decoupling scheme. We couple the above two distillation processes in an online optimization framework to form new feature representations of RGB and thermal modalities without modality gap. In addition, we design a masked modeling strategy and a multi-modal candidate token elimination strategy into CKD to improve tracking robustness and efficiency respectively.

However, the high computation costs associated with two-stage detection methods cause more severe thermal issues on edge devices, incurring dynamic runtime frequency change and thus large inference latency variations. Furthermore, the dynamic number of proposals in different frames leads to various computations over time, resulting in further latency variations. The significant latency variations of detectors on edge devices can harm user experience and waste hardware resources. To avoid thermal throttling and provide stable inference speed, we propose Lotus, a novel framework that is tailored for two-stage detectors to dynamically scale CPU and GPU frequencies jointly in an online manner based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To demonstrate the effectiveness of Lotus, we implement it on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Mi 11 Lite mobile platforms. The results indicate that Lotus can consistently and significantly reduce latency variation, achieve faster inference, and maintain lower CPU and GPU temperatures under various settings.

To address this limitation, we introduce One-Shot Style Adaptation (OSSA), a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method for object detection that utilizes a single, unlabeled target image to approximate the target domain style. Specifically, OSSA generates diverse target styles by perturbing the style statistics derived from a single target image and then applies these styles to a labeled source dataset at the feature level using Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN). Extensive experiments show that OSSA establishes a new state-of-the-art among one-shot domain adaptation methods by a significant margin, and in some cases, even outperforms strong baselines that use thousands of unlabeled target images. By applying OSSA in various scenarios, including weather, simulated-to-real (sim2real), and visual-to-thermal adaptations, our study explores the overarching significance of the style gap in these contexts. OSSA's simplicity and efficiency allow easy integration into existing frameworks, providing a potentially viable solution for practical applications with limited data availability.

While deep learning has advanced RGB-based segmentation, performance degrades under adverse conditions like low illumination or motion blur. Thermal imaging offers complementary information by capturing emitted radiation, improving crack detection in challenging environments. Combining RGB and thermal images (RGB-T) for crack segmentation shows promise in complex real-world conditions, such as adverse weather, yet research in this area remains limited. Current RGB-T segmentation methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary relationships between modalities at various levels of interaction. To address this, we propose IRFusionFormer, a novel model for crack segmentation that effectively integrates RGB and thermal data. Our Efficient RGB-T Cross Fusion Module captures multi-scale relationships and long-range dependencies between modalities without significant computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce the Interaction-Hybrid-Branch-Supervision framework, which enhances interaction between modalities by distributing fused features across branches with joint supervision. To maintain the topological structure of cracks, we introduce a novel topology-based loss function that preserves connectivity during training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Dice score of 90.01% and an IoU of 81.83%, significantly improving robustness and accuracy in varying environmental conditions. These advancements address key challenges in pavement crack segmentation, offering a more reliable and efficient solution.

Existing approaches often involve designing specific additional branches and performing full-parameter fine-tuning for fusion in each task. However, this paradigm not only duplicates research efforts and hardware costs but also risks model collapse with the limited multi-modal annotated data. In this paper, we propose a universal framework named X-Prompt for all multi-modal video object segmentation tasks, designated as RGB+X. The X-Prompt framework first pre-trains a video object segmentation foundation model using RGB data, and then utilize the additional modality of the prompt to adapt it to downstream multi-modal tasks with limited data. Within the X-Prompt framework, we introduce the Multi-modal Visual Prompter (MVP), which allows prompting foundation model with the various modalities to segment objects precisely. We further propose the Multi-modal Adaptation Experts (MAEs) to adapt the foundation model with pluggable modality-specific knowledge without compromising the generalization capacity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the X-Prompt framework, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks across 4 benchmarks. The proposed universal X-Prompt framework consistently outperforms the full fine-tuning paradigm and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code: https://github.com/PinxueGuo/X-Prompt.git

Among the available technologies, visual images offer high accuracy, while sensing on the RF spectrum preserves privacy, creating a conflict between imaging resolution and privacy preservation. In this paper, we explore thermal array sensors as an emerging modality that strikes an excellent resolution-privacy balance for ubiquitous sensing. To this end, we present TADAR, the first multi-user Thermal Array-based Detection and Ranging system that estimates the inherently missing range information, extending thermal array outputs from 2D thermal pixels to 3D depths and empowering them as a promising modality for ubiquitous privacy-preserving human sensing. We prototype TADAR using a single commodity thermal array sensor and conduct extensive experiments in different indoor environments. Our results show that TADAR achieves a mean F1 score of 88.8% for multi-user detection and a mean accuracy of 32.0 cm for multi-user ranging, which further improves to 20.1 cm for targets located within 3 m. We conduct two case studies on fall detection and occupancy estimation to showcase the potential applications of TADAR. We hope TADAR will inspire the vast community to explore new directions of thermal array sensing, beyond wireless and acoustic sensing.

In comparison to visible light imaging, thermal infrared imaging offers the advantage of all-weather imaging and strong penetration, providing increased possibilities for reconstruction in nighttime and adverse weather scenarios. However, thermal infrared imaging is influenced by physical characteristics such as atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction, hindering the precise reconstruction of intricate details in thermal infrared scenes, manifesting as issues of floaters and indistinct edge features in synthesized images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a physics-induced 3D Gaussian splatting method named Thermal3D-GS. Thermal3D-GS begins by modeling atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction in three-dimensional media using neural networks. Additionally, a temperature consistency constraint is incorporated into the optimization objective to enhance the reconstruction accuracy of thermal infrared images. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our method, the first large-scale benchmark dataset for this field named Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis Dataset (TI-NSD) is created. This dataset comprises 20 authentic thermal infrared video scenes, covering indoor, outdoor, and UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) scenarios, totaling 6,664 frames of thermal infrared image data. Based on this dataset, this paper experimentally verifies the effectiveness of Thermal3D-GS. The results indicate that our method outperforms the baseline method with a 3.03 dB improvement in PSNR and significantly addresses the issues of floaters and indistinct edge features present in the baseline method.

However, TIR images often face challenges such as jitter, and wildlife overlap, necessitating UAVs to possess the capability to identify blurred and overlapping small targets. Current traditional lightweight networks deployed on UAVs struggle to extract features from blurry small targets. To address this issue, we developed ALSS-YOLO, an efficient and lightweight detector optimized for TIR aerial images. Firstly, we propose a novel Adaptive Lightweight Channel Split and Shuffling (ALSS) module. This module employs an adaptive channel split strategy to optimize feature extraction and integrates a channel shuffling mechanism to enhance information exchange between channels. This improves the extraction of blurry features, crucial for handling jitter-induced blur and overlapping targets. Secondly, we developed a Lightweight Coordinate Attention (LCA) module that employs adaptive pooling and grouped convolution to integrate feature information across dimensions. This module ensures lightweight operation while maintaining high detection precision and robustness against jitter and target overlap. Additionally, we developed a single-channel focus module to aggregate the width and height information of each channel into four-dimensional channel fusion, which improves the feature representation efficiency of infrared images. Finally, we modify the localization loss function to emphasize the loss value associated with small objects to improve localization accuracy. Extensive experiments on the BIRDSAI and ISOD TIR UAV wildlife datasets show that ALSS-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, Our code is openly available at https://github.com/helloworlder8/computer_vision.

For the better segmentation, depth and thermal infrared modalities serve as the supplement to RGB images in the complex scenes. Existing methods specifically design various feature extraction and multi-modal fusion strategies for RGB, RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, and Visual-Depth-Thermal image input respectively, leading to similar model flood. As the recently proposed Segment Anything Model (SAM) possesses extraordinary segmentation and prompt interactive capability, we propose an SSSOD family based on SAM, named SSFam, for the combination input with different modalities. Firstly, different modal-aware modulators are designed to attain modal-specific knowledge which cooperates with modal-agnostic information extracted from the frozen SAM encoder for the better feature ensemble. Secondly, a siamese decoder is tailored to bridge the gap between the training with scribble prompt and the testing with no prompt for the stronger decoding ability. Our model demonstrates the remarkable performance among combinations of different modalities and refreshes the highest level of scribble supervised methods and comes close to the ones of fully supervised methods. https://github.com/liuzywen/SSFam

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to explore and exploit the powerful feature representation and zero-shot generalization ability of the pre-trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multi-modal SOD. Despite serving as a recent vision fundamental model, driving the class-agnostic SAM to comprehend and detect salient objects accurately is non-trivial, especially in challenging scenes. To this end, we develop \underline{SAM} with se\underline{m}antic f\underline{e}ature fu\underline{s}ion guidanc\underline{e} (Sammese), which incorporates multi-modal saliency-specific knowledge into SAM to adapt SAM to multi-modal SOD tasks. However, it is difficult for SAM trained on single-modal data to directly mine the complementary benefits of multi-modal inputs and comprehensively utilize them to achieve accurate saliency prediction. To address these issues, we first design a multi-modal complementary fusion module to extract robust multi-modal semantic features by integrating information from visible and thermal or depth image pairs. Then, we feed the extracted multi-modal semantic features into both the SAM image encoder and mask decoder for fine-tuning and prompting, respectively. Specifically, in the image encoder, a multi-modal adapter is proposed to adapt the single-modal SAM to multi-modal information. In the mask decoder, a semantic-geometric prompt generation strategy is proposed to produce corresponding embeddings with various saliency cues. Extensive experiments on both RGB-D and RGB-T SOD benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The code will be available at \url{https://github.com/Angknpng/Sammese}.

They have made remarkable progress in computer vision tasks by aligning text modality with vision inputs. There are also endeavors to incorporate multi-vision sensors beyond RGB, including thermal, depth, and medical X-ray images. However, we observe that current LVLMs view images taken from multi-vision sensors as if they were in the same RGB domain without considering the physical characteristics of multi-vision sensors. They fail to convey the fundamental multi-vision sensor information from the dataset and the corresponding contextual knowledge properly. Consequently, alignment between the information from the actual physical environment and the text is not achieved correctly, making it difficult to answer complex sensor-related questions that consider the physical environment. In this paper, we aim to establish a multi-vision Sensor Perception And Reasoning benchmarK called SPARK that can reduce the fundamental multi-vision sensor information gap between images and multi-vision sensors. We generated 6,248 vision-language test samples to investigate multi-vision sensory perception and multi-vision sensory reasoning on physical sensor knowledge proficiency across different formats, covering different types of sensor-related questions.

However, general guidance to model architecture design is still missing. Inspired by the connection between image representation learning and heat conduction, we model images by the heat conduction equation, where the essential idea is to conceptualize image features as temperatures and model their information interaction as the diffusion of thermal energy. Based on this idea, we find that many modern model architectures, such as residual structures, SE block, and feed-forward networks, can be interpreted from the perspective of the heat conduction equation. Therefore, we leverage the heat equation to design new and more interpretable models. As an example, we propose the Heat Conduction Layer and the Refinement Approximation Layer inspired by solving the heat conduction equation using Finite Difference Method and Fourier series, respectively. The main goal of this paper is to integrate the overall architectural design of neural networks into the theoretical framework of heat conduction. Nevertheless, our Heat Conduction Network (HcNet) still shows competitive performance, e.g., HcNet-T achieves 83.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K while only requiring 28M parameters and 4.1G MACs.

Several challenges exist for pedestrian detection in autonomous driving applications. First, it is difficult to perform accurate detection using RGB cameras under dark or low-light conditions. Cross-spectral systems must be developed to integrate complementary information from multiple sensor modalities, such as thermal and visible cameras, to improve the robustness of the detections. Second, pedestrian detection models are latency-sensitive. Efficient and easy-to-scale detection models with fewer parameters are highly desirable for real-time applications such as autonomous driving. Third, pedestrian video data provides spatial-temporal correlations of pedestrian movement. It is beneficial to incorporate temporal as well as spatial information to enhance pedestrian detection. This work leverages recent advances in the state space model (Mamba) and proposes a novel Multi-head Hierarchical Patching and Aggregation (MHHPA) structure to extract both fine-grained and coarse-grained information from both RGB and thermal imagery. Experimental results show that the proposed MHHPA is an effective and efficient alternative to a Transformer model for cross-spectral pedestrian detection.

In this work, we contribute a large-scale Visible-Thermal video benchmark for MOT, called VT-MOT. VT-MOT has the following main advantages. 1) The data is large scale and high diversity. VT-MOT includes 582 video sequence pairs, 401k frame pairs from surveillance, drone, and handheld platforms. 2) The cross-modal alignment is highly accurate. We invite several professionals to perform both spatial and temporal alignment frame by frame. 3) The annotation is dense and high-quality. VT-MOT has 3.99 million annotation boxes annotated and double-checked by professionals, including heavy occlusion and object re-acquisition (object disappear and reappear) challenges. To provide a strong baseline, we design a simple yet effective tracking framework, which effectively fuses temporal information and complementary information of two modalities in a progressive manner, for robust visible-thermal MOT. A comprehensive experiment are conducted on VT-MOT and the results prove the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods.

To overcome the gap between different modalities, we propose a modal emulation-based two-pass multi-modal crowd-counting framework that enables efficient modal emulation, alignment, and fusion. The framework consists of two key components: a \emph{multi-modal inference} pass and a \emph{cross-modal emulation} pass. The former utilizes a hybrid cross-modal attention module to extract global and local information and achieve efficient multi-modal fusion. The latter uses attention prompting to coordinate different modalities and enhance multi-modal alignment. We also introduce a modality alignment module that uses an efficient modal consistency loss to align the outputs of the two passes and bridge the semantic gap between modalities.

However, most diffusion models are limited to visible RGB image generation. In fact, human perception of the world is enriched by diverse viewpoints, such as chromatic contrast, thermal illumination, and depth information. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion model for general layout-guided cross-modal generation, called DiffX. Notably, our DiffX presents a compact and effective cross-modal generative modeling pipeline, which conducts diffusion and denoising processes in the modality-shared latent space. Moreover, we introduce the Joint-Modality Embedder (JME) to enhance the interaction between layout and text conditions by incorporating a gated attention mechanism. To facilitate the user-instructed training, we construct the cross-modal image datasets with detailed text captions by the Large-Multimodal Model (LMM) and our human-in-the-loop refinement. Through extensive experiments, our DiffX demonstrates robustness in cross-modal ''RGB+X'' image generation on FLIR, MFNet, and COME15K datasets, guided by various layout conditions. Meanwhile, it shows the strong potential for the adaptive generation of ``RGB+X+Y(+Z)'' images or more diverse modalities on FLIR, MFNet, COME15K, and MCXFace datasets. To our knowledge, DiffX is the first model for layout-guided cross-modal image generation. Our code and constructed cross-modal image datasets are available at https://github.com/zeyuwang-zju/DiffX.

Traditional tracking methods predominantly rely on hand-crafted features, and while deep learning has introduced correlation filtering techniques, these are often constrained by rudimentary correlation operations. Furthermore, transformer-based approaches tend to overlook temporal and coordinate information, which is critical for TIR tracking that lacks texture and color information. In this paper, to address these issues, we apply natural language modeling to TIR tracking and propose a coordinate-aware thermal infrared tracking model called NLMTrack, which enhances the utilization of coordinate and temporal information. NLMTrack applies an encoder that unifies feature extraction and feature fusion, which simplifies the TIR tracking pipeline. To address the challenge of low detail and low contrast in TIR images, on the one hand, we design a multi-level progressive fusion module that enhances the semantic representation and incorporates multi-scale features. On the other hand, the decoder combines the TIR features and the coordinate sequence features using a causal transformer to generate the target sequence step by step. Moreover, we explore an adaptive loss aimed at elevating tracking accuracy and a simple template update strategy to accommodate the target's appearance variations. Experiments show that NLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. The Code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ELOESZHANG/NLMTrack}.

This task is challenging due to the significant gap between these distinct modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by introducing an auxiliary broker modality and on this basis frame the task as a triple-modal learning problem. We devise a fusion-based method to generate this broker modality, leveraging a non-diffusion, lightweight counterpart of modern denoising diffusion-based fusion models. Additionally, we identify and address the ghosting effect caused by direct cross-modal image fusion in multi-modal crowd counting.

However, they mainly focus on either visible or thermal modality, while visible-thermal (RGBT) bimodality is rarely explored. Although some RGBT datasets have been developed recently, the insufficient quantity, limited category, misaligned images and large target size cannot provide an impartial benchmark to evaluate multi-category visible-thermal small object detection (RGBT SOD) algorithms. In this paper, we build the first large-scale benchmark with high diversity for RGBT SOD (namely RGBT-Tiny), including 115 paired sequences, 93K frames and 1.2M manual annotations. RGBT-Tiny contains abundant targets (7 categories) and high-diversity scenes (8 types that cover different illumination and density variations). Note that, over 81% of targets are smaller than 16x16, and we provide paired bounding box annotations with tracking ID to offer an extremely challenging benchmark with wide-range applications, such as RGBT fusion, detection and tracking. In addition, we propose a scale adaptive fitness (SAFit) measure that exhibits high robustness on both small and large targets. The proposed SAFit can provide reasonable performance evaluation and promote detection performance. Based on the proposed RGBT-Tiny dataset and SAFit measure, extensive evaluations have been conducted, including 23 recent state-of-the-art algorithms that cover four different types (i.e., visible generic detection, visible SOD, thermal SOD and RGBT object detection).

Fluctuating hydrodynamics was originally introduced by Landau and Lifshitz as a way to put thermal fluctuations into a continuum framework by including a stochastic forcing to each dissipative transport process (e.g., heat flux). While FHD has been useful in modeling transport and fluid dynamics at the mesoscopic scale, theoretical calculations have been feasible only with simplifying assumptions. As such there is great interest in numerical schemes for Computational Fluctuating Hydrodynamics (CFHD). There are a variety of algorithms (e.g., spectral, finite element, lattice Boltzmann) but in this introduction we focus on finite volume schemes.

Creating a landmark dataset is time-consuming, but AI-assisted annotation can help. However, applying AI to thermal images is challenging due to suboptimal results from direct thermal training and infeasible RGB-thermal alignment due to different camera views. Therefore, we opt to transfer models trained on RGB to thermal images and refine them using our AI-assisted annotation tool following a semi-automatic annotation approach. Accurately localizing facial key points on both RGB and thermal images enables us to not only discern the cattle's respiratory signs but also measure temperatures to assess the animal's thermal state. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset for the cattle facial landmark on RGB-T images.

Existing methods generally design different fusion schemes to handle certain issues or challenges. Although these fusion schemes are effective at addressing specific issues or challenges, they may struggle to handle multiple complex challenges simultaneously. To solve this problem, we propose a novel adaptive fusion bank that makes full use of the complementary benefits from a set of basic fusion schemes to handle different challenges simultaneously for robust MSOD. We focus on handling five major challenges in MSOD, namely center bias, scale variation, image clutter, low illumination, and thermal crossover or depth ambiguity. The fusion bank proposed consists of five representative fusion schemes, which are specifically designed based on the characteristics of each challenge, respectively. The bank is scalable, and more fusion schemes could be incorporated into the bank for more challenges. To adaptively select the appropriate fusion scheme for multi-modal input, we introduce an adaptive ensemble module that forms the adaptive fusion bank, which is embedded into hierarchical layers for sufficient fusion of different source data. Moreover, we design an indirect interactive guidance module to accurately detect salient hollow objects via the skip integration of high-level semantic information and low-level spatial details. Extensive experiments on three RGBT datasets and seven RGBD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the outstanding performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing methods are tailored for manually aligned image pairs, which are labor-intensive, and directly applying these methods to original unaligned image pairs could significantly degrade their performance. In this paper, we make the first attempt to address RGBT SOD for initially captured RGB and thermal image pairs without manual alignment. Specifically, we propose a Semantics-guided Asymmetric Correlation Network (SACNet) that consists of two novel components: 1) an asymmetric correlation module utilizing semantics-guided attention to model cross-modal correlations specific to unaligned salient regions; 2) an associated feature sampling module to sample relevant thermal features according to the corresponding RGB features for multi-modal feature integration. In addition, we construct a unified benchmark dataset called UVT2000, containing 2000 RGB and thermal image pairs directly captured from various real-world scenes without any alignment, to facilitate research on alignment-free RGBT SOD. Extensive experiments on both aligned and unaligned datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our method.

While a generalist model capable of leveraging all modalities would be ideal, development is hindered by data sparsity, typically in practice, only one modality is available at a time. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure and achieve that knowledge gained from multimodal sensing -- such as identifying relevant features and regions -- is effectively shared, even when certain modalities are unavailable at inference. We venture with a simple assumption: similar samples across different modalities have more knowledge to share than otherwise. To implement this, we employ a ``weak" classifier tasked with distinguishing between modalities. More specifically, if the classifier ``fails" to accurately identify the modality of the given sample, this signals an opportunity for cross-modal knowledge sharing. Intuitively, knowledge transfer is facilitated whenever a sample from one modality is sufficiently close and aligned with another. Technically, we achieve this by routing samples from one modality to the expert of the others, within a mixture-of-experts framework designed for multimodal video object tracking. During the inference, the expert of the respective modality is chosen, which we show to benefit from the multimodal knowledge available during training, thanks to the proposed method. Through the exhaustive experiments that use only paired RGB-E, RGB-D, and RGB-T during training, we showcase the benefit of the proposed method for RGB-X tracker during inference, with an average +3\% precision improvement over the current SOTA.

In this study, we aim to mitigate this challenge by introducing the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) built upon the physical heat conduction principle. HCO conceptualizes image patches as heat sources and models their correlations through adaptive thermal energy diffusion, enabling robust visual representations. HCO enjoys a computational complexity of O(N^1.5), as it can be implemented using discrete cosine transformation (DCT) operations. HCO is plug-and-play, combining with deep learning backbones produces visual representation models (termed vHeat) with global receptive fields. Experiments across vision tasks demonstrate that, beyond the stronger performance, vHeat achieves up to a 3x throughput, 80% less GPU memory allocation, and 35% fewer computational FLOPs compared to the Swin-Transformer.

While the two-branch structure achieves better performance than a single-branch structure, it overlooks inference efficiency. This conflict is increasingly aggressive, as recent works solely pursue higher performance rather than both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we address this issue by improving the performance of efficient single-branch structures. We revisit the reasons causing the performance gap between these structures. For the first time, we reveal the information interference problem in the naive early-fusion strategy adopted by previous single-branch structures. Besides, we find that the domain gap between multispectral images, and weak feature representation of the single-branch structure are also key obstacles for performance. Focusing on these three problems, we propose corresponding solutions, including a novel shape-priority early-fusion strategy, a weakly supervised learning method, and a core knowledge distillation technique. Experiments demonstrate that single-branch networks equipped with these three contributions achieve significant performance enhancements while retaining high efficiency.

We propose Fieldscale, a rescaling based on locality-aware 2D fields where both the intensity value and spatial context of each pixel within an image are embedded. It can adaptively determine the pixel gain for each region and produce spatially consistent 8-bit rescaled images with minimal information loss and high visibility. Consistent performance improvement on image quality assessment and two other downstream tasks support the effectiveness and usability of Fieldscale.

It is of great significance for many applications such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance. In recent years, MMOT has received more and more attention. However, existing MMOT algorithms mainly focus on two modalities (\eg RGB+depth, RGB+thermal infrared, and RGB+language). To leverage more modalities, some recent efforts have been made to learn a unified visual object tracking model for any modality. Additionally, some large-scale multi-modal tracking benchmarks have been established by simultaneously providing more than two modalities, such as vision-language-audio (\eg WebUAV-3M) and vision-depth-language (\eg UniMod1K). To track the latest progress in MMOT, we conduct a comprehensive investigation in this report. Specifically, we first divide existing MMOT tasks into five main categories, \ie RGBL tracking, RGBE tracking, RGBD tracking, RGBT tracking, and miscellaneous (RGB+X), where X can be any modality, such as language, depth, and event. Then, we analyze and summarize each MMOT task, focusing on widely used datasets and mainstream tracking algorithms based on their technical paradigms (\eg self-supervised learning, prompt learning, knowledge distillation, generative models, and state space models).

The DC framework differs from traditional Bayesian approaches due to the incorporation of the push-forward of an initial density, which performs selective regularization in parameter directions not informed by the data in the resulting updated density. This extends a previous study that included the linear Gaussian theory within the DC framework and introduced the maximal updated density (MUD) estimate as an alternative to both least squares and maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates. In this work, we introduce algorithms for operational settings of MUD estimation in real or near-real time where spatio-temporal datasets arrive in packets to provide updated estimates of parameters and identify potential parameter drift. Computational diagnostics within the DC framework prove critical for evaluating (1) the quality of the DC update and MUD estimate and (2) the detection of parameter value drift. The algorithms are applied to estimate (1) wind drag parameters in a high-fidelity storm surge model, (2) thermal diffusivity field for a heat conductivity problem, and (3) changing infection and incubation rates of an epidemiological model.

Some previous methods either do not fully exploit the potential of RGB and TIR information for channel and spatial feature fusion or lack a direct interaction between the template and the search area, which limits the model's ability to fully utilize the original semantic information of both modalities. To address these limitations, we investigate how to achieve a direct fusion of cross-modal channels and spatial features in RGB-T tracking and propose CSTNet. It uses the Vision Transformer (ViT) as the backbone and adds a Joint Spatial and Channel Fusion Module (JSCFM) and Spatial Fusion Module (SFM) integrated between the transformer blocks to facilitate cross-modal feature interaction. The JSCFM module achieves joint modeling of channel and multi-level spatial features. The SFM module includes a cross-attention-like architecture for cross modeling and joint learning of RGB and TIR features. Comprehensive experiments show that CSTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. To enhance practicality, we retrain the model without JSCFM and SFM modules and use CSNet as the pretraining weight, and propose CSTNet-small, which achieves 50% speedup with an average decrease of 1-2% in SR and PR performance.

However, existing benchmarks predominantly contain videos collected in common scenarios where both RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) information are of sufficient quality. This weakens the representativeness of existing benchmarks in severe imaging conditions, leading to tracking failures in MMW scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present a new benchmark considering the modality validity, MV-RGBT, captured specifically from MMW scenarios where either RGB (extreme illumination) or TIR (thermal truncation) modality is invalid. Hence, it is further divided into two subsets according to the valid modality, offering a new compositional perspective for evaluation and providing valuable insights for future designs. Moreover, MV-RGBT is the most diverse benchmark of its kind, featuring 36 different object categories captured across 19 distinct scenes. Furthermore, considering severe imaging conditions in MMW scenarios, a new problem is posed in RGBT tracking, named `when to fuse', to stimulate the development of fusion strategies for such scenarios. To facilitate its discussion, we propose a new solution with a mixture of experts, named MoETrack, where each expert generates independent tracking results along with a confidence score. Extensive results demonstrate the significant potential of MV-RGBT in advancing RGBT tracking and elicit the conclusion that fusion is not always beneficial, especially in MMW scenarios. Besides, MoETrack achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, including MV-RGBT, GTOT, and LasHeR. Github: https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/MVRGBT.

Conventional super-resolution (SR) methods often struggle with thermal images due to their lack of high-frequency details. Guided SR leverages information from a high-resolution image, typically in the visible spectrum, to enhance the reconstruction of a high-res IR image from the low-res input. Inspired by SwinFusion, we propose SwinFuSR, a guided SR architecture based on Swin transformers. In real world scenarios, however, the guiding modality (e.g. RBG image) may be missing, so we propose a training method that improves the robustness of the model in this case. Our method has few parameters and outperforms state of the art models in terms of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural SIMilarity (SSIM). In Track 2 of the PBVS 2024 Thermal Image Super-Resolution Challenge, it achieves 3rd place in the PSNR metric.

To address this, XoFTR incorporates masked image modeling pre-training and fine-tuning with pseudo-thermal image augmentation to handle the modality differences. Additionally, we introduce a refined matching pipeline that adjusts for scale discrepancies and enhances match reliability through sub-pixel level refinement.

Leveraging additional modalities (X-modality) like thermal and depth alongside traditional RGB provides complementary information, enabling more robust and reliable prediction. In this work, we introduce Sigma, a Siamese Mamba network for multi-modal semantic segmentation utilizing the advanced Mamba. Unlike conventional methods that rely on CNNs, with their limited local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers (ViTs), which offer global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic complexity, our model achieves global receptive fields with linear complexity. By employing a Siamese encoder and innovating a Mamba-based fusion mechanism, we effectively select essential information from different modalities. A decoder is then developed to enhance the channel-wise modeling ability of the model. Our proposed method is rigorously evaluated on both RGB-Thermal and RGB-Depth semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating its superiority and marking the first successful application of State Space Models (SSMs) in multi-modal perception tasks.

In addition to challenging front-end data association, thermal imagery presents an additional difficulty for long term relocalization and map reuse. The relative temperatures of objects in thermal imagery change dramatically from day to night. Feature descriptors typically used for relocalization in SLAM are unable to maintain consistency over these diurnal changes. We show that learned feature descriptors can be used within existing Bag of Word based localization schemes to dramatically improve place recognition across large temporal gaps in thermal imagery. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our trained vocabulary, we have developed a baseline SLAM system, integrating learned features and matching into a classical SLAM algorithm. Our system demonstrates good local tracking on challenging thermal imagery, and relocalization that overcomes dramatic day to night thermal appearance changes.

Thermal infrared-based computer vision detection techniques provide a straightforward approach to identify gas leakage areas. However, the development of high-quality algorithms has been challenging due to the low texture in thermal images and the lack of open-source datasets. In this paper, we present the RGB-Thermal Cross Attention Network (RT-CAN), which employs an RGB-assisted two-stream network architecture to integrate texture information from RGB images and gas area information from thermal images. Additionally, to facilitate the research of invisible gas detection, we introduce Gas-DB, an extensive open-source gas detection database including about 1.3K well-annotated RGB-thermal images with eight variant collection scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully leverages the advantages of both modalities, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among RGB-thermal methods, surpassing single-stream SOTA models in terms of accuracy, Intersection of Union (IoU), and F2 metrics by 4.86%, 5.65%, and 4.88%, respectively.

Early research focused on fully fine-tuning RGB-based trackers, which was inefficient and lacked generalized representation due to the scarcity of multimodal data. Therefore, recent studies have utilized prompt tuning to transfer pre-trained RGB-based trackers to multimodal data. However, the modality gap limits pre-trained knowledge recall, and the dominance of the RGB modality persists, preventing the full utilization of information from other modalities. To address these issues, we propose a novel symmetric multimodal tracking framework called SDSTrack. We introduce lightweight adaptation for efficient fine-tuning, which directly transfers the feature extraction ability from RGB to other domains with a small number of trainable parameters and integrates multimodal features in a balanced, symmetric manner. Furthermore, we design a complementary masked patch distillation strategy to enhance the robustness of trackers in complex environments, such as extreme weather, poor imaging, and sensor failure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDSTrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various multimodal tracking scenarios, including RGB+Depth, RGB+Thermal, and RGB+Event tracking, and exhibits impressive results in extreme conditions.

However, there are limited studies on adapting from the visible to the thermal domain, because the domain gap between the visible and thermal domains is much larger than expected, and traditional domain adaptation can not successfully facilitate learning in this situation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Distinctive Dual-Domain Teacher (D3T) framework that employs distinct training paradigms for each domain. Specifically, we segregate the source and target training sets for building dual-teachers and successively deploy exponential moving average to the student model to individual teachers of each domain. The framework further incorporates a zigzag learning method between dual teachers, facilitating a gradual transition from the visible to thermal domains during training. We validate the superiority of our method through newly designed experimental protocols with well-known thermal datasets, i.e., FLIR and KAIST.

However, real-world MRI acquisitions already contain inherent noise due to thermal fluctuations. This phenomenon is particularly notable when using ultra-fast, high-resolution imaging sequences for advanced research, or using low-field systems favored by low- and middle-income countries. These common scenarios can lead to sub-optimal performance or complete failure of existing diffusion model-based reconstruction techniques. Specifically, as the artificially added noise is gradually removed, the inherent MRI noise becomes increasingly pronounced, making the actual noise level inconsistent with the predefined denoising schedule and consequently inaccurate image reconstruction. To tackle this problem, we propose a posterior sampling strategy with a novel NoIse Level Adaptive Data Consistency (Nila-DC) operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and an in-house clinical dataset with field strength ranging from 0.3T to 3T, showing that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods, and is highly robust against various noise levels.

However, existing methods rely on black-box thermal dynamics models and stochastic optimizers, lacking reliability guarantees and posing risks to occupant health. In this work, we overcome the reliability bottleneck by redesigning HVAC controllers using decision trees extracted from existing thermal dynamics models and historical data. Our decision tree-based policies are deterministic, verifiable, interpretable, and more energy-efficient than current MBRL methods. First, we introduce a novel verification criterion for RL agents in HVAC control based on domain knowledge. Second, we develop a policy extraction procedure that produces a verifiable decision tree policy. We found that the high dimensionality of the thermal dynamics model input hinders the efficiency of policy extraction. To tackle the dimensionality challenge, we leverage importance sampling conditioned on historical data distributions, significantly improving policy extraction efficiency. Lastly, we present an offline verification algorithm that guarantees the reliability of a control policy. Extensive experiments show that our method saves 68.4% more energy and increases human comfort gain by 14.8% compared to the state-of-the-art method, in addition to an 1127x reduction in computation overhead.

MMAUD addresses a critical gap in contemporary threat detection methodologies by focusing on drone detection, UAV-type classification, and trajectory estimation. MMAUD stands out by combining diverse sensory inputs, including stereo vision, various Lidars, Radars, and audio arrays. It offers a unique overhead aerial detection vital for addressing real-world scenarios with higher fidelity than datasets captured on specific vantage points using thermal and RGB. Additionally, MMAUD provides accurate Leica-generated ground truth data, enhancing credibility and enabling confident refinement of algorithms and models, which has never been seen in other datasets. Most existing works do not disclose their datasets, making MMAUD an invaluable resource for developing accurate and efficient solutions. Our proposed modalities are cost-effective and highly adaptable, allowing users to experiment and implement new UAV threat detection tools. Our dataset closely simulates real-world scenarios by incorporating ambient heavy machinery sounds. This approach enhances the dataset's applicability, capturing the exact challenges faced during proximate vehicular operations.

Adverse weather conditions, including haze, dust, rain, snow, and darkness, introduce significant challenges to accurate dense depth estimation, thereby posing substantial safety risks in autonomous driving. These challenges are particularly pronounced for traditional depth estimation methods that rely on short electromagnetic wave sensors, such as visible spectrum cameras and near-infrared LiDAR, due to their susceptibility to diffraction noise and occlusion in such environments. To fundamentally overcome this issue, we present a novel approach for robust metric depth estimation by fusing a millimeter-wave Radar and a monocular infrared thermal camera, which are capable of penetrating atmospheric particles and unaffected by lighting conditions. Our proposed Radar-Infrared fusion method achieves highly accurate and finely detailed dense depth estimation through three stages, including monocular depth prediction with global scale alignment, quasi-dense Radar augmentation by learning Radar-pixels correspondences, and local scale refinement of dense depth using a scale map learner. Our method achieves exceptional visual quality and accurate metric estimation by addressing the challenges of ambiguity and misalignment that arise from directly fusing multi-modal long-wave features. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the NTU4DRadLM dataset and our self-collected challenging ZJU-Multispectrum dataset. Especially noteworthy is the unprecedented robustness demonstrated by our proposed method in smoky scenarios. Our code will be released at \url{https://github.com/MMOCKING/RIDERS}.

For the existing RGB-T semantic segmentation methods, however, the effective exploration of the complementary relationship between different modalities is not implemented in the information interaction between multiple levels. To address such an issue, the Context-Aware Interaction Network (CAINet) is proposed for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which constructs interaction space to exploit auxiliary tasks and global context for explicitly guided learning. Specifically, we propose a Context-Aware Complementary Reasoning (CACR) module aimed at establishing the complementary relationship between multimodal features with the long-term context in both spatial and channel dimensions. Further, considering the importance of global contextual and detailed information, we propose the Global Context Modeling (GCM) module and Detail Aggregation (DA) module, and we introduce specific auxiliary supervision to explicitly guide the context interaction and refine the segmentation map. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets of MFNet and PST900 demonstrate that the proposed CAINet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In pursuit of this objective, a novel X Modality Assisting Network (X-Net) is introduced, which explores the impact of the fusion paradigm by decoupling visual object tracking into three distinct levels, thereby facilitating subsequent processing. Initially, to overcome the challenges associated with feature learning due to significant discrepancies between RGB and thermal modalities, a plug-and-play pixel-level generation module (PGM) based on knowledge distillation learning is proposed. This module effectively generates the X modality, bridging the gap between the two patterns while minimizing noise interference. Subsequently, to optimize sample feature representation and promote cross-modal interactions, a feature-level interaction module (FIM) is introduced, integrating a mixed feature interaction transformer and a spatial dimensional feature translation strategy. Finally, to address random drifting caused by missing instance features, a flexible online optimization strategy called the decision-level refinement module (DRM) is proposed, which incorporates optical flow and refinement mechanisms. The efficacy of X-Net is validated through experiments on three benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art trackers. Notably, X-Net achieves performance gains of 0.47%/1.2% in the average of precise rate and success rate, respectively. Additionally, the research content, data, and code are pledged to be made publicly accessible at https://github.com/DZSYUNNAN/XNet.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel invertible prompt learning approach, which integrates the content-preserving prompts into a well-trained tracking model to adapt to various modality-missing scenarios, for robust RGBT tracking. Given one modality-missing scenario, we propose to utilize the available modality to generate the prompt of the missing modality to adapt to RGBT tracking model. However, the cross-modality gap between available and missing modalities usually causes semantic distortion and information loss in prompt generation. To handle this issue, we design the invertible prompter by incorporating the full reconstruction of the input available modality from the generated prompt. To provide a comprehensive evaluation platform, we construct several high-quality benchmark datasets, in which various modality-missing scenarios are considered to simulate real-world challenges. Extensive experiments on three modality-missing benchmark datasets show that our method achieves significant performance improvements compared with state-of-the-art methods. We have released the code and simulation datasets at: \href{https://github.com/Alexadlu/Modality-missing-RGBT-Tracking.git}{https://github.com/Alexadlu/Modality-missing-RGBT-Tracking.git}.

While such a dataset is crucial for safety monitoring in wildland fire applications, to the authors' awareness, no such dataset focusing on assets near fire is publicly available. Presumably, this is due to the barrier to entry of collaborating with fire management personnel. We present two related data subsets: WIT-UAS-ROS consists of full ROS bag files containing sensor and robot data of UAS flight over the fire, and WIT-UAS-Image contains hand-labeled long-wave infrared (LWIR) images extracted from WIT-UAS-ROS. Our dataset is the first to focus on asset detection in a wildland fire environment. We show that thermal detection models trained without fire data frequently detect false positives by classifying fire as people. By adding our dataset to training, we show that the false positive rate is reduced significantly. Yet asset detection in wildland fire environments is still significantly more challenging than detection in urban environments, due to dense obscuring trees, greater heat variation, and overbearing thermal signal of the fire. We publicize this dataset to encourage the community to study more advanced models to tackle this challenging environment. The dataset, code and pretrained models are available at \url{https://github.com/castacks/WIT-UAS-Dataset}.

However, developing completely different models for different tasks leads to labor and time consumption, as well as high computational and practical deployment costs. In this paper, we attempt to address both single-modal and multi-modal SOD in a unified framework called UniSOD, which fully exploits the overlapping prior knowledge between different tasks. Nevertheless, assigning appropriate strategies to modality variable inputs is challenging. To this end, UniSOD learns modality-aware prompts with task-specific hints through adaptive prompt learning, which are plugged into the proposed pre-trained baseline SOD model to handle corresponding tasks, while only requiring few learnable parameters compared to training the entire model. Each modality-aware prompt is generated from a switchable prompt generation block, which adaptively performs structural switching based on single-modal and multi-modal inputs without human intervention. Through end-to-end joint training, UniSOD achieves overall performance improvement on 14 benchmark datasets for RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T SOD, which demonstrates that our method effectively and efficiently unifies single-modal and multi-modal SOD tasks.The code and results are available at https://github.com/Angknpng/UniSOD.

In practice, most existing RGB trackers learn a single set of parameters to use them across datasets and applications. However, a similar single-model unification for multi-modality tracking presents several challenges. These challenges stem from the inherent heterogeneity of inputs -- each with modality-specific representations, the scarcity of multi-modal datasets, and the absence of all the modalities at all times. In this work, we introduce Un-Track, a Unified Tracker of a single set of parameters for any modality. To handle any modality, our method learns their common latent space through low-rank factorization and reconstruction techniques. More importantly, we use only the RGB-X pairs to learn the common latent space. This unique shared representation seamlessly binds all modalities together, enabling effective unification and accommodating any missing modality, all within a single transformer-based architecture. Our Un-Track achieves +8.1 absolute F-score gain, on the DepthTrack dataset, by introducing only +2.14 (over 21.50) GFLOPs with +6.6M (over 93M) parameters, through a simple yet efficient prompting strategy. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets with different modalities show that Un-Track surpasses both SOTA unified trackers and modality-specific counterparts, validating our effectiveness and practicality.

We focus on this class of surrogate models given the similarity between their message-passing update mechanism and the traditional physics solver update, and the possibility of enforcing known physical priors into the graph construction and update. We show that our model learns the kinetic plasma dynamics of the one-dimensional plasma model, a predecessor of contemporary kinetic plasma simulation codes, and recovers a wide range of well-known kinetic plasma processes, including plasma thermalization, electrostatic fluctuations about thermal equilibrium, and the drag on a fast sheet and Landau damping. We compare the performance against the original plasma model in terms of run-time, conservation laws, and temporal evolution of key physical quantities. The limitations of the model are presented and possible directions for higher-dimensional surrogate models for kinetic plasmas are discussed.

Additionally, the lack of data for training robust models adds another limitation in effectively studying complex forest conditions. This paper presents a novel method for detecting shadowed tree crowns and provides a challenging dataset comprising roughly 50k paired RGB-thermal images to facilitate future research for illumination-invariant detection. The proposed method (ShadowSense) is entirely self-supervised, leveraging domain adversarial training without source domain annotations for feature extraction and foreground feature alignment for feature pyramid networks to adapt domain-invariant representations by focusing on visible foreground regions, respectively. It then fuses complementary information of both modalities to effectively improve upon the predictions of an RGB-trained detector and boost the overall accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over both the baseline RGB-trained detector and state-of-the-art techniques that rely on unsupervised domain adaptation or early image fusion.

However, LiDAR- and visual- SLAM may easily fail in adverse conditions (rain, snow, smoke and fog, etc.). In comparison, SLAM based on 4D Radar, thermal camera and IMU can work robustly. But only a few literature can be found. A major reason is the lack of related datasets, which seriously hinders the research. Even though some datasets are proposed based on 4D radar in past four years, they are mainly designed for object detection, rather than SLAM. Furthermore, they normally do not include thermal camera. Therefore, in this paper, NTU4DRadLM is presented to meet this requirement. The main characteristics are: 1) It is the only dataset that simultaneously includes all 6 sensors: 4D radar, thermal camera, IMU, 3D LiDAR, visual camera and RTK GPS. 2) Specifically designed for SLAM tasks, which provides fine-tuned ground truth odometry and intentionally formulated loop closures. 3) Considered both low-speed robot platform and fast-speed unmanned vehicle platform. 4) Covered structured, unstructured and semi-structured environments. 5) Considered both middle- and large- scale outdoor environments, i.e., the 6 trajectories range from 246m to 6.95km. 6) Comprehensively evaluated three types of SLAM algorithms.

However, most existing works focus on designing architectures and constructing visual cues only for the specific task, which ignores the potential uniformity introduced by the DL paradigm. In this paper, we attempt to construct a novel $\underline{ComP}$lementary $\underline{tr}$ansformer, $\textbf{ComPtr}$, for diverse bi-source dense prediction tasks. Specifically, unlike existing methods that over-specialize in a single task or a subset of tasks, ComPtr starts from the more general concept of bi-source dense prediction. Based on the basic dependence on information complementarity, we propose consistency enhancement and difference awareness components with which ComPtr can evacuate and collect important visual semantic cues from different image sources for diverse tasks, respectively. ComPtr treats different inputs equally and builds an efficient dense interaction model in the form of sequence-to-sequence on top of the transformer. This task-generic design provides a smooth foundation for constructing the unified model that can simultaneously deal with various bi-source information. In extensive experiments across several representative vision tasks, i.e. remote sensing change detection, RGB-T crowd counting, RGB-D/T salient object detection, and RGB-D semantic segmentation, the proposed method consistently obtains favorable performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach by mining the Cross-Modal Semantics to guide the fusion and decoding of multimodal features, with the aim of controlling the modal contribution based on relative entropy. We explore semantics among the multimodal inputs in two aspects: the modality-shared consistency and the modality-specific variation. Specifically, we propose a novel network, termed XMSNet, consisting of (1) all-round attentive fusion (AF), (2) coarse-to-fine decoder (CFD), and (3) cross-layer self-supervision. On the one hand, the AF block explicitly dissociates the shared and specific representation and learns to weight the modal contribution by adjusting the \textit{proportion, region,} and \textit{pattern}, depending upon the quality. On the other hand, our CFD initially decodes the shared feature and then refines the output through specificity-aware querying. Further, we enforce semantic consistency across the decoding layers to enable interaction across network hierarchies, improving feature discriminability. Exhaustive comparison on eleven datasets with depth or thermal clues, and on two challenging tasks, namely salient and camouflage object segmentation, validate our effectiveness in terms of both performance and robustness.

We show that all combinations of paired data are not necessary to train such a joint embedding, and only image-paired data is sufficient to bind the modalities together. ImageBind can leverage recent large scale vision-language models, and extends their zero-shot capabilities to new modalities just by using their natural pairing with images. It enables novel emergent applications 'out-of-the-box' including cross-modal retrieval, composing modalities with arithmetic, cross-modal detection and generation. The emergent capabilities improve with the strength of the image encoder and we set a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Finally, we show strong few-shot recognition results outperforming prior work, and that ImageBind serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks.

Inferring the Past with Thermal Imaging</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>Inferring past human motion from RGB images is challenging due to the inherent uncertainty of the prediction problem. Thermal images, on the other hand, encode traces of past human-object interactions left in the environment via thermal radiation measurement. Based on this observation, we collect the first RGB-Thermal dataset for human motion analysis, dubbed Thermal-IM. Then we develop a three-stage neural network model for accurate past human pose estimation. Comprehensive experiments show that thermal cues significantly reduce the ambiguities of this task, and the proposed model achieves remarkable performance.

Visible-thermal infrared stereo poses several challenges, including occlusions and differently textured matching regions in both spectra. Finding matches between two spectra with varying colors, textures, and shapes adds further complexity to the task. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach where a high-resolution convolutional neural network is used to better capture relationships between the two spectra. To do so, a modified HRNet backbone is used for feature extraction. This HRNet backbone is capable of capturing fine details and textures as it extracts features at multiple scales, thereby enabling the utilization of both local and global information. For matching visible and thermal infrared regions, our method extracts features on each patch using two modified HRNet streams. Features from the two streams are then combined for predicting the disparities by concatenation and correlation. Results on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by improving the results by approximately 18 percentage points on the $\leq$ 1 pixel error, highlighting its potential for improving accuracy in this task.

SAM can accurately segment images across diverse fields, and generating various masks. We discovered that this ability of SAM can be leveraged to pretrain models for specific fields. Accordingly, we have proposed a framework that utilizes SAM to generate pseudo labels for pretraining thermal infrared image segmentation tasks. Our proposed framework can effectively improve the accuracy of segmentation results of specific categories beyond the SOTA ImageNet pretrained model. Our framework presents a novel approach to collaborate with models trained with large data like SAM to address problems in special fields. Also, we generated a large scale thermal infrared segmentation dataset used for pretaining, which contains over 100,000 images with pixel-annotation labels.

We captured MONET to study the problem of object localisation and behaviour understanding of targets undergoing large-scale variations and being recorded from different and moving viewpoints. Target activities occur in two different land sites, each with unique scene structures and cluttered backgrounds. MONET consists of approximately 53K images featuring 162K manually annotated bounding boxes. Each image is timestamp-aligned with drone metadata that includes information about attitudes, speed, altitude, and GPS coordinates. MONET is different from previous thermal drone datasets because it features multimodal data, including rural scenes captured with thermal cameras containing both person and vehicle targets, along with trajectory information and metadata. We assessed the difficulty of the dataset in terms of transfer learning between the two sites and evaluated nine object detection algorithms to identify the open challenges associated with this type of data.

Super-Resolution approaches can broaden their usefulness by replicating accurate high-resolution thermal pictures using measurements from low-cost, low-resolution thermal sensors. Because of the spectral range mismatch between the images, Guided Super-Resolution of thermal images utilizing visible range images is difficult. However, In case of failure to capture Visible Range Images can prevent the operations of applications in critical areas. We present a novel data fusion framework and regularization technique for Guided Super Resolution of Thermal images. The proposed architecture is computationally in-expensive and lightweight with the ability to maintain performance despite missing one of the modalities, i.e., high-resolution RGB image or the lower-resolution thermal image, and is designed to be robust in the presence of missing data. The proposed method presents a promising solution to the frequently occurring problem of missing modalities in a real-world scenario. Code is available at https://github.com/Kasliwal17/CoReFusion .

However, the previous studies mostly focus on designing a multi-modal fusion module without consideration of the nature of multi-modality inputs. Therefore, the networks easily become over-reliant on a single modality, making it difficult to learn complementary and meaningful representations for each modality. This paper proposes 1) a complementary random masking strategy of RGB-T images and 2) self-distillation loss between clean and masked input modalities. The proposed masking strategy prevents over-reliance on a single modality. It also improves the accuracy and robustness of the neural network by forcing the network to segment and classify objects even when one modality is partially available. Also, the proposed self-distillation loss encourages the network to extract complementary and meaningful representations from a single modality or complementary masked modalities. Based on the proposed method, we achieve state-of-the-art performance over three RGB-T semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our source code is available at https://github.com/UkcheolShin/CRM_RGBTSeg.

Thermal information provides useful clues when visual cameras suffer from poor lighting conditions, such as low light and fog. However, how to effectively fuse RGB images and thermal data remains an open challenge. Previous works involve naive fusion strategies such as merging them at the input, concatenating multi-modality features inside models, or applying attention to each data modality. These fusion strategies are straightforward yet insufficient. In this paper, we propose a novel fusion method named Explicit Attention-Enhanced Fusion (EAEF) that fully takes advantage of each type of data. Specifically, we consider the following cases: i) both RGB data and thermal data, ii) only one of the types of data, and iii) none of them generate discriminative features. EAEF uses one branch to enhance feature extraction for i) and iii) and the other branch to remedy insufficient representations for ii). The outputs of two branches are fused to form complementary features. As a result, the proposed fusion method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.6\% in mIoU on semantic segmentation, 3.1\% in MAE on salient object detection, 2.3\% in mAP on object detection, and 8.1\% in MAE on crowd counting.

To inherit the powerful representations of the foundation model, a natural modus operandi for multi-modal tracking is full fine-tuning on the RGB-based parameters. Albeit effective, this manner is not optimal due to the scarcity of downstream data and poor transferability, etc. In this paper, inspired by the recent success of the prompt learning in language models, we develop Visual Prompt multi-modal Tracking (ViPT), which learns the modal-relevant prompts to adapt the frozen pre-trained foundation model to various downstream multimodal tracking tasks. ViPT finds a better way to stimulate the knowledge of the RGB-based model that is pre-trained at scale, meanwhile only introducing a few trainable parameters (less than 1% of model parameters). ViPT outperforms the full fine-tuning paradigm on multiple downstream tracking tasks including RGB+Depth, RGB+Thermal, and RGB+Event tracking. Extensive experiments show the potential of visual prompt learning for multi-modal tracking, and ViPT can achieve state-of-the-art performance while satisfying parameter efficiency.

Due to the presence of two modalities, misalignment and modality imbalance are the most significant issues in multispectral pedestrian detection. In this paper, we propose M ulti S pectral pedestrian DE tection TR ansformer (MS-DETR) to fix above issues. MS-DETR consists of two modality-specific backbones and Transformer encoders, followed by a multi-modal Transformer decoder, and the visible and thermal features are fused in the multi-modal Transformer decoder. To well resist the misalignment between multi-modal images, we design a loosely coupled fusion strategy by sparsely sampling some keypoints from multi-modal features independently and fusing them with adaptively learned attention weights. Moreover, based on the insight that not only different modalities, but also different pedestrian instances tend to have different confidence scores to final detection, we further propose an instance-aware modality-balanced optimization strategy, which preserves visible and thermal decoder branches and aligns their predicted slots through an instance-wise dynamic loss. Our end-to-end MS-DETR shows superior performance on the challenging KAIST, CVC-14 and LLVIP benchmark datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/YinghuiXing/MS-DETR.

It provides enhanced safety and improved awareness features for driver assistance. The system is trained on large-scale thermal public datasets as well as newly gathered novel open-sourced dataset comprising of more than 35,000 distinct thermal frames. For optimal training and convergence of YOLO-v5 tiny network variant on thermal data, we have employed different optimizers which include stochastic decent gradient (SGD), Adam, and its variant AdamW which has an improved implementation of weight decay. The performance of thermally tuned tiny architecture is further evaluated on the public as well as locally gathered test data in diversified and challenging weather and environmental conditions. The efficacy of a thermally tuned nano network is quantified using various qualitative metrics which include mean average precision, frames per second rate, and average inference time. Experimental outcomes show that the network achieved the best mAP of 56.4% with an average inference time/ frame of 4 milliseconds. The study further incorporates optimization of tiny network variant using the TensorFlow Lite quantization tool this is beneficial for the deployment of deep learning architectures on the edge and mobile devices. For this study, we have used a raspberry pi 4 computing board for evaluating the real-time feasibility performance of an optimized version of the thermal object detection network for the automotive sensor suite.

It is friendly towards salient object detection (SOD) in which the input and output have the same resolution. However, two critical problems need to be solved for two-modality SOD. One problem is two-modality fusion. The other problem is the HRFormer output's fusion. To address the first problem, a supplementary modality is injected into the primary modality by using global optimization and an attention mechanism to select and purify the modality at the input level. To solve the second problem, a dual-direction short connection fusion module is used to optimize the output features of HRFormer, thereby enhancing the detailed representation of objects at the output level. The proposed model, named HRTransNet, first introduces an auxiliary stream for feature extraction of supplementary modality. Then, features are injected into the primary modality at the beginning of each multi-resolution branch. Next, HRFormer is applied to achieve forwarding propagation. Finally, all the output features with different resolutions are aggregated by intra-feature and inter-feature interactive transformers. Application of the proposed model results in impressive improvement for driving two-modality SOD tasks, e.g., RGB-D, RGB-T, and light field SOD.https://github.com/liuzywen/HRTransNet

Our approach is based on continuum stochastic hydrodynamic equations that are subject to shear boundary conditions on the unit periodic cell in a manner similar to the Lees-Edwards conditions of molecular dynamics. Our methods take into account consistently the microstructure elastic mechanics, fluid-structure hydrodynamic coupling, and thermal fluctuations. For practical simulations, we develop numerical methods for efficient stochastic field generation that handle the sheared generalized periodic boundary conditions. We show that our numerical methods are consistent with fluctuation dissipation balance and near-equilibrium statistical mechanics. As a demonstration in practice, we present several prototype rheological response studies. These include (i) shear thinning of a polymeric fluid, (ii) complex moduli for the oscillatory responses of a polymerized lipid vesicle, and (iii) aging under shear of a gel-like material.

Regardless of the domain, anomaly detection is typically framed as a one-class classification task, where the learning is conducted on normal examples only. An entire family of successful anomaly detection methods is based on learning to reconstruct masked normal inputs (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and exerting the magnitude of the reconstruction error as an indicator for the abnormality level. Unlike other reconstruction-based methods, we present a novel self-supervised masked convolutional transformer block (SSMCTB) that comprises the reconstruction-based functionality at a core architectural level. The proposed self-supervised block is extremely flexible, enabling information masking at any layer of a neural network and being compatible with a wide range of neural architectures. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised predictive convolutional attentive block (SSPCAB) with a 3D masked convolutional layer, a transformer for channel-wise attention, as well as a novel self-supervised objective based on Huber loss. Furthermore, we show that our block is applicable to a wider variety of tasks, adding anomaly detection in medical images and thermal videos to the previously considered tasks based on RGB images and surveillance videos. We exhibit the generality and flexibility of SSMCTB by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art neural models for anomaly detection, bringing forth empirical results that confirm considerable performance improvements on five benchmarks. We release our code and data as open source at: https://github.com/ristea/ssmctb.

The algorithm generates new solutions through Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques. This sampling scheme can result in severe limitations, such as slow convergence and a tendency to stay within the same local search space at small temperatures. To overcome these shortcomings, we use the variational classical annealing (VCA) framework that combines autoregressive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with traditional annealing to sample solutions that are uncorrelated. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of using VCA as an approach to solving real-world optimization problems. We explore VCA's performance in comparison with SA at solving three popular optimization problems: the maximum cut problem (Max-Cut), the nurse scheduling problem (NSP), and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). For all three problems, we find that VCA outperforms SA on average in the asymptotic limit by one or more orders of magnitude in terms of relative error. Interestingly, we reach large system sizes of up to $256$ cities for the TSP. We also conclude that in the best case scenario, VCA can serve as a great alternative when SA fails to find the optimal solution.

Due to the large difference between the transmission property of visible light and that of the thermal energy through the glass where most glass is transparent to the visible light but opaque to thermal energy, glass regions of a scene are made more distinguishable with a pair of RGB and thermal images than solely with an RGB image. To exploit such a unique property, we propose a neural network architecture that effectively combines an RGB-thermal image pair with a new multi-modal fusion module based on attention, and integrate CNN and transformer to extract local features and non-local dependencies, respectively. As well, we have collected a new dataset containing 5551 RGB-thermal image pairs with ground-truth segmentation annotations. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on fusing RGB and thermal data for glass segmentation.

Moreover, the HIT-UAV provides essential flight data for each image, such as flight altitude, camera perspective, date, and daylight intensity. For each image, we have manually annotated object instances with bounding boxes of two types (oriented and standard) to tackle the challenge of significant overlap of object instances in aerial images. To the best of our knowledge, the HIT-UAV is the first publicly available high-altitude UAV-based infrared thermal dataset for detecting persons and vehicles. We have trained and evaluated well-established object detection algorithms on the HIT-UAV. Our results demonstrate that the detection algorithms perform exceptionally well on the HIT-UAV compared to visual light datasets since infrared thermal images do not contain significant irrelevant information about objects. We believe that the HIT-UAV will contribute to various UAV-based applications and researches. The dataset is freely available at https://github.com/suojiashun/HIT-UAV-Infrared-Thermal-Dataset.

Pixel-wise semantic segmentation of RGB images can be advanced by exploiting complementary features from the supplementary modality (X-modality). However, covering a wide variety of sensors with a modality-agnostic model remains an unresolved problem due to variations in sensor characteristics among different modalities. Unlike previous modality-specific methods, in this work, we propose a unified fusion framework, CMX, for RGB-X semantic segmentation. To generalize well across different modalities, that often include supplements as well as uncertainties, a unified cross-modal interaction is crucial for modality fusion. Specifically, we design a Cross-Modal Feature Rectification Module (CM-FRM) to calibrate bi-modal features by leveraging the features from one modality to rectify the features of the other modality. With rectified feature pairs, we deploy a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to perform sufficient exchange of long-range contexts before mixing. To verify CMX, for the first time, we unify five modalities complementary to RGB, i.e., depth, thermal, polarization, event, and LiDAR. Extensive experiments show that CMX generalizes well to diverse multi-modal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performances on five RGB-Depth benchmarks, as well as RGB-Thermal, RGB-Polarization, and RGB-LiDAR datasets. Besides, to investigate the generalizability to dense-sparse data fusion, we establish an RGB-Event semantic segmentation benchmark based on the EventScape dataset, on which CMX sets the new state-of-the-art. The source code of CMX is publicly available at https://github.com/huaaaliu/RGBX_Semantic_Segmentation.

However, the precise value of the effective mass of uniform electron gas is still elusive after decades of research. The newly developed neural canonical transformation approach [Xie et al., J. Mach. Learn. 1, (2022)] offers a principled way to extract the effective mass of electron gas by directly calculating the thermal entropy at low temperature. The approach models a variational many-electron density matrix using two generative neural networks: an autoregressive model for momentum occupation and a normalizing flow for electron coordinates. Our calculation reveals a suppression of effective mass in the two-dimensional spin-polarized electron gas, which is more pronounced than previous reports in the low-density strong-coupling region. This prediction calls for verification in two-dimensional electron gas experiments.

The inherent local connectivity of the convolution operation constrains the performance of the convolution-based methods to a ceiling. In this work, we rethink these tasks from the perspective of global information alignment and transformation. Specifically, the proposed \underline{c}ross-mod\underline{a}l \underline{v}iew-mixed transform\underline{er} (CAVER) cascades several cross-modal integration units to construct a top-down transformer-based information propagation path. CAVER treats the multi-scale and multi-modal feature integration as a sequence-to-sequence context propagation and update process built on a novel view-mixed attention mechanism. Besides, considering the quadratic complexity w.r.t. the number of input tokens, we design a parameter-free patch-wise token re-embedding strategy to simplify operations. Extensive experimental results on RGB-D and RGB-T SOD datasets demonstrate that such a simple two-stream encoder-decoder framework can surpass recent state-of-the-art methods when it is equipped with the proposed components.

Among these foundation models, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), introduced by Meta AI Research, stands out as a groundbreaking solution for object segmentation tasks. While SAM has shown success in various agricultural applications, its potential in the poultry industry, specifically in the context of cage-free hens, remains relatively unexplored. This study aims to assess the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM on representative chicken segmentation tasks, including part-based segmentation and the use of infrared thermal images, and to explore chicken-tracking tasks by using SAM as a segmentation tool. The results demonstrate SAM's superior performance compared to SegFormer and SETR in both whole and part-based chicken segmentation. SAM-based object tracking also provides valuable data on the behavior and movement patterns of broiler birds. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of SAM's potential in poultry science and lay the foundation for future advancements in chicken segmentation and tracking.

This could be achieved by infecting device binaries with malware that modifies the physical characteristics of the system operation. Mitigating such attacks benefits from reverse engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of mathematical equations of the implemented algorithm. Conventional reverse engineering tools can decompile binaries to low-level code, but offer little semantic insight. This paper proposes the REMaQE automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from binary executables. Improving over state-of-the-art, REMaQE handles equation parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or pointers, and can reverse engineer object-oriented implementations such as C++ classes. Using REMaQE, we discovered a bug in the Linux kernel thermal monitoring tool "tmon". To evaluate REMaQE, we generate a dataset of 25,096 binaries with math equations implemented in C and Simulink. REMaQE successfully recovers a semantically matching equation for all 25,096 binaries. REMaQE executes in 0.48 seconds on average and in up to 2 seconds for complex equations. Real-time execution enables integration in an interactive math-oriented reverse engineering workflow.

Recently, multi-spectral depth estimation, which integrates both visible light and thermal images, has shown promise in addressing this issue. However, existing algorithms struggle with precise pixel-level feature matching, limiting their ability to fully exploit geometric constraints across different spectra. To address this, we propose a novel framework incorporating stereo depth estimation to enforce accurate geometric constraints. In particular, we treat the visible light and thermal images as a stereo pair and utilize a Cross-modal Feature Matching (CFM) Module to construct a cost volume for pixel-level matching. To mitigate the effects of poor lighting on stereo matching, we introduce Degradation Masking, which leverages robust monocular thermal depth estimation in degraded regions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Multi-Spectral Stereo (MS2) dataset, with qualitative evaluations demonstrating high-quality depth maps under varying lighting conditions.

In this study, we propose DefectSAM, a novel approach for segmenting defects on highly noisy thermal images based on the widely adopted model, Segment Anything (SAM)\cite{kirillov2023segany}. Harnessing the power of a meticulously curated dataset generated through labor-intensive lab experiments and valuable prompts from experienced experts, DefectSAM surpasses existing state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms and achieves significant improvements in defect detection rates. Notably, DefectSAM excels in detecting weaker and smaller defects on complex and irregular surfaces, reducing the occurrence of missed detections and providing more accurate defect size estimations. Experimental studies conducted on various materials have validated the effectiveness of our solutions in defect detection, which hold significant potential to expedite the evolution of defect detection tools, enabling enhanced inspection capabilities and accuracy in defect identification.

Although promising tracking performance is achieved through leveraging complementary cues from different sources, it remains challenging in complex scenes due to the limitations of bi-modal scenarios. In this work, we introduce a general multimodal visual tracking task that fully exploits the advantages of four modalities, including RGB, thermal infrared, event, and language, for robust tracking under challenging conditions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation platform for general multimodal visual tracking, we construct QuadTrack600, a large-scale, high-quality benchmark comprising 600 video sequences (totaling 384.7K high-resolution (640x480) frame groups). In each frame group, all four modalities are spatially aligned and meticulously annotated with bounding boxes, while 21 sequence-level challenge attributes are provided for detailed performance analysis. Despite quad-modal data provides richer information, the differences in information quantity among modalities and the computational burden from four modalities are two challenging issues in fusing four modalities. To handle these issues, we propose a novel approach called QuadFusion, which incorporates an efficient Multiscale Fusion Mamba with four different scanning scales to achieve sufficient interactions of the four modalities while overcoming the exponential computational burden, for general multimodal visual tracking. Extensive experiments on the QuadTrack600 dataset and three bi-modal tracking datasets, including LasHeR, VisEvent, and TNL2K, validate the effectiveness of our QuadFusion.

In recent years, cross-modal information fusion has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance retrieval robustness. By integrating complementary information from different spectral modalities, it becomes possible to achieve more stable person recognition and matching under complex real-world conditions. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel task: Text-RGBT Person Retrieval, which incorporates cross-spectrum information fusion by combining the complementary cues from visible and thermal modalities for robust person retrieval in challenging environments. The key challenge of Text-RGBT person retrieval lies in aligning text with multi-modal visual features. However, the inherent heterogeneity between visible and thermal modalities may interfere with the alignment between vision and language. To handle this problem, we propose a Decoupled Cross-modal Alignment network (DCAlign), which sufficiently mines the relationships between modality-specific and modality-collaborative visual with the text, for Text-RGBT person retrieval. To promote the research and development of this field, we create a high-quality Text-RGBT person retrieval dataset, RGBT-PEDES. RGBT-PEDES contains 1,822 identities from different age groups and genders with 4,723 pairs of calibrated RGB and T images, and covers high-diverse scenes from both daytime and nighttime with a various of challenges such as occlusion, weak alignment and adverse lighting conditions. Additionally, we carefully annotate 7,987 fine-grained textual descriptions for all RGBT person image pairs. Extensive experiments on RGBT-PEDES demonstrate that our method outperforms existing text-image person retrieval methods.

Existing works often study complex fusion models to handle challenging scenarios, but can not well adapt to various challenges, which might limit tracking performance. To handle this problem, we propose a novel Dynamic Disentangled Fusion Network called DDFNet, which disentangles the fusion process into several dynamic fusion models via the challenge attributes to adapt to various challenging scenarios, for robust RGBT tracking. In particular, we design six attribute-based fusion models to integrate RGB and thermal features under the six challenging scenarios respectively.Since each fusion model is to deal with the corresponding challenges, such disentangled fusion scheme could increase the fusion capacity without the dependence on large-scale training data. Considering that every challenging scenario also has different levels of difficulty, we propose to optimize the combination of multiple fusion units to form each attribute-based fusion model in a dynamic manner, which could well adapt to the difficulty of the corresponding challenging scenario. To address the issue that which fusion models should be activated in the tracking process, we design an adaptive aggregation fusion module to integrate all features from attribute-based fusion models in an adaptive manner with a three-stage training algorithm. In addition, we design an enhancement fusion module to further strengthen the aggregated feature and modality-specific features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DDFNet against other state-of-the-art methods.

To address this issue, this paper presents a novel All-layer multimodal Interaction Network, named AINet, which performs efficient and effective feature interactions of all modalities and layers in a progressive fusion Mamba, for robust RGBT tracking. Even though modality features in different layers are known to contain different cues, it is always challenging to build multimodal interactions in each layer due to struggling in balancing interaction capabilities and efficiency. Meanwhile, considering that the feature discrepancy between RGB and thermal modalities reflects their complementary information to some extent, we design a Difference-based Fusion Mamba (DFM) to achieve enhanced fusion of different modalities with linear complexity. When interacting with features from all layers, a huge number of token sequences (3840 tokens in this work) are involved and the computational burden is thus large. To handle this problem, we design an Order-dynamic Fusion Mamba (OFM) to execute efficient and effective feature interactions of all layers by dynamically adjusting the scan order of different layers in Mamba. Extensive experiments on four public RGBT tracking datasets show that AINet achieves leading performance against existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, the problem of missing arbitrary modalities is very common in real life, and this problem is less studied, but actually important in the task of multi-modality person re-identification (Re-ID). To this end, we design a novel dynamic enhancement network (DENet), which allows missing arbitrary modalities while maintaining the representation ability of multiple modalities, for partial multi-modality person Re-ID. To be specific, the multi-modal representation of the RGB, near-infrared (NIR) and thermal-infrared (TIR) images is learned by three branches, in which the information of missing modalities is recovered by the feature transformation module. Since the missing state might be changeable, we design a dynamic enhancement module, which dynamically enhances modality features according to the missing state in an adaptive manner, to improve the multi-modality representation. Extensive experiments on multi-modality person Re-ID dataset RGBNT201 and vehicle Re-ID dataset RGBNT100 comparing to the state-of-the-art methods verify the effectiveness of our method in complex and changeable environments.

To accomplish that, the forced convection on a hot plate prone to a pulsating cooling jet with variable velocity has been investigated. We begin with evaluating the efficiency and viability of a vanilla Deep Q-Network (DQN) method for thermal control. Subsequently, a comprehensive comparison between different variants of DRL is conducted. Soft Double and Duel DQN achieved better thermal control performance among all the variants due to their efficient learning and action prioritization capabilities. Results demonstrate that the soft Double DQN outperforms the hard Double DQN. Moreover, soft Double and Duel can maintain the temperature in the desired threshold for more than 98% of the control cycle. These findings demonstrate the promising potential of DRL in effectively addressing thermal control systems.

To address this, integrating additional thermal radiation data with RGB images demonstrates enhanced performance and robustness. However, how to effectively reconcile the modality discrepancies and fuse the RGB and thermal features remains a well-known challenge. In this work, we address this challenge from a novel spectral perspective. We observe that the multi-modal features can be categorized into two spectral components: low-frequency features that provide broad scene context, including color variations and smooth areas, and high-frequency features that capture modality-specific details such as edges and textures. Inspired by this, we propose the Spectral-aware Global Fusion Network (SGFNet) to effectively enhance and fuse the multi-modal features by explicitly modeling the interactions between the high-frequency, modality-specific features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the MFNet and PST900 datasets.

With HVAC systems accounting for about 40% of the total energy cost in the commercial sector, we propose a low-complexity DRL-based model with multi-input multi-output architecture for the HVAC energy optimization of open-plan offices, which uses only a handful of controllable and accessible factors. The efficacy of our solution is evaluated through extensive analysis of the overall energy consumption and thermal comfort levels compared to a baseline system based on the existing HVAC schedule in a real building. This comparison shows that our method achieves 37% savings in energy consumption with minimum violation (<1%) of the desired temperature range during work hours. It takes only a total of 40 minutes for 5 epochs (about 7.75 minutes per epoch) to train a network with superior performance and covering diverse conditions for its low-complexity architecture; therefore, it easily adapts to changes in the building setups, weather conditions, occupancy rate, etc. Moreover, by enforcing smoothness on the control strategy, we suppress the frequent and unpleasant on/off transitions on HVAC units to avoid occupant discomfort and potential damage to the system. The generalizability of our model is verified by applying it to different building models and under various weather conditions.

To efficiently satisfy real-time multi-input multi-output (MIMO) optimal power requirements, high-end processors integrate an on-die power controller system (PCS).
  While traditional PCSs are based on a simple microcontroller (MCU)-class core, more scalable and flexible PCS architectures are required to support advanced MIMO control algorithms for managing the ever-increasing number of cores, power states, and process, voltage, and temperature variability.
  This paper presents ControlPULP, an open-source, HW/SW RISC-V parallel PCS platform consisting of a single-core MCU with fast interrupt handling coupled with a scalable multi-core programmable cluster accelerator and a specialized DMA engine for the parallel acceleration of real-time power management policies. ControlPULP relies on FreeRTOS to schedule a reactive power control firmware (PCF) application layer.
  We demonstrate ControlPULP in a power management use-case targeting a next-generation 72-core HPC processor. We first show that the multi-core cluster accelerates the PCF, achieving 4.9x speedup compared to single-core execution, enabling more advanced power management algorithms within the control hyper-period at a shallow area overhead, about 0.1% the area of a modern HPC CPU die. We then assess the PCS and PCF by designing an FPGA-based, closed-loop emulation framework that leverages the heterogeneous SoCs paradigm, achieving DVFS tracking with a mean deviation within 3% the plant's thermal design power (TDP) against a software-equivalent model-in-the-loop approach. Finally, we show that the proposed PCF compares favorably with an industry-grade control algorithm under computational-intensive workloads.

However, VLOD can not effectively work in dark and temperature-sensitive scenarios. Instead, thermal infrared object detection (TIOD) is the most accessible and practical in such environments. In this paper, our team is the first to investigate the security vulnerabilities associated with TIOD in the context of backdoor attacks, spanning both the digital and physical realms. We introduce two novel types of backdoor attacks on TIOD, each offering unique capabilities: Object-affecting Attack and Range-affecting Attack. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of key factors influencing trigger design, which include temperature, size, material, and concealment. These factors, especially temperature, significantly impact the efficacy of backdoor attacks on TIOD. A thorough understanding of these factors will serve as a foundation for designing physical triggers and temperature controlling experiments. Our study includes extensive experiments conducted in both digital and physical environments. In the digital realm, we evaluate our approach using benchmark datasets for TIOD, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of up to 98.21%. In the physical realm, we test our approach in two real-world settings: a traffic intersection and a parking lot, using a thermal infrared camera. Here, we attain an ASR of up to 98.38%.

However, for a real machine, e.g., a robot, sensors could be added or removed at any time. Thus, it is crucial to enable the machine to tackle the mismatch and unequal-scale problems of modality combinations between training and inference. In this paper, we tackle these problems from a new perspective: "Modalities Help Modalities". Intuitively, we present OmniBind, a novel two-stage learning framework that can achieve any modality combinations and interaction. It involves teaching data-constrained, a.k.a, student, modalities to be aligned with the well-trained data-abundant, a.k.a, teacher, modalities. This subtly enables the adaptive fusion of any modalities to build a unified representation space for any combinations. Specifically, we propose Cross-modal Alignment Distillation (CAD) to address the unequal-scale problem between student and teacher modalities and effectively align student modalities into the teacher modalities' representation space in stage one. We then propose an Adaptive Fusion (AF) module to fuse any modality combinations and learn a unified representation space in stage two. To address the mismatch problem, we aggregate existing datasets and combine samples from different modalities by the same semantics. This way, we build the first dataset for training and evaluation that consists of teacher (image, text) and student (touch, thermal, event, point cloud, audio) modalities and enables omni-bind for any of them. Extensive experiments on the recognition task show performance gains over prior arts by an average of 4.05 % on the arbitrary modality combination setting. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance for a single modality, e.g., touch, with a 4.34 % gain.

Existing works, eg., ImageBind, treat the image as the central modality and build an image-centered representation space; however, the space may be sub-optimal as it leads to an unbalanced representation space among all modalities. Moreover, the category names are directly used to extract text embeddings for the downstream tasks, making it hardly possible to represent the semantics of multi-modal data. The 'out-of-the-box' insight of our UniBind is to make the alignment center modality-agnostic and further learn a unified and balanced representation space, empowered by the large language models (LLMs). UniBind is superior in its flexible application to all CLIP-style models and delivers remarkable performance boosts. To make this possible, we 1) construct a knowledge base of text embeddings with the help of LLMs and multi-modal LLMs; 2) adaptively build LLM-augmented class-wise embedding center on top of the knowledge base and encoded visual embeddings; 3) align all the embeddings to the LLM-augmented embedding center via contrastive learning to achieve a unified and balanced representation space. UniBind shows strong zero-shot recognition performance gains over prior arts by an average of 6.36%. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance, eg., a 6.75% gain on ImageNet, on the multi-modal fine-tuning setting while reducing 90% of the learnable parameters.

For example, when we see a cattery and simultaneously perceive the cat's purring sound, our brain can construct a picture of a cat in the cattery. Intuitively, generative AI models should hold the versatility of humans and be capable of generating images from any combination of modalities efficiently and collaboratively. This paper presents ImgAny, a novel end-to-end multi-modal generative model that can mimic human reasoning and generate high-quality images. Our method serves as the first attempt in its capacity of efficiently and flexibly taking any combination of seven modalities, ranging from language, audio to vision modalities, including image, point cloud, thermal, depth, and event data. Our key idea is inspired by human-level cognitive processes and involves the integration and harmonization of multiple input modalities at both the entity and attribute levels without specific tuning across modalities. Accordingly, our method brings two novel training-free technical branches: 1) Entity Fusion Branch ensures the coherence between inputs and outputs. It extracts entity features from the multi-modal representations powered by our specially constructed entity knowledge graph; 2) Attribute Fusion Branch adeptly preserves and processes the attributes. It efficiently amalgamates distinct attributes from diverse input modalities via our proposed attribute knowledge graph. Lastly, the entity and attribute features are adaptively fused as the conditional inputs to the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for image generation. Extensive experiments under diverse modality combinations demonstrate its exceptional capability for visual content creation.

Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module, correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$ improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

To address these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

It requires not only the effective extraction of features from both modalities and robust fusion strategies, but also the ability to address issues such as spectral discrepancies, spatial misalignment, and environmental dependencies between RGB and TIR images. These challenges significantly hinder the generalization of multispectral detection systems across diverse scenarios. Although numerous studies have attempted to overcome these limitations, it remains difficult to clearly distinguish the performance gains of multispectral detection systems from the impact of these "optimization techniques". Worse still, despite the rapid emergence of high-performing single-modality detection models, there is still a lack of specialized training techniques that can effectively adapt these models for multispectral detection tasks. The absence of a standardized benchmark with fair and consistent experimental setups also poses a significant barrier to evaluating the effectiveness of new approaches. To this end, we propose the first fair and reproducible benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the training "techniques", which systematically classifies existing multispectral object detection methods, investigates their sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and standardizes the core configurations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted across multiple representative multispectral object detection datasets, utilizing various backbone networks and detection frameworks. Additionally, we introduce an efficient and easily deployable multispectral object detection framework that can seamlessly optimize high-performing single-modality models into dual-modality models, integrating our advanced training techniques.

Traditional RGB-T semantic segmentation models often struggle to generalize across diverse scenarios due to their reliance on pretrained models and predefined categories. Recent advancements in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have facilitated a shift from closed-set to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods. However, these models face challenges in dealing with intricate scenes, primarily due to the heterogeneity between RGB and thermal modalities. To address this gap, we present Open-RGBT, a novel open-vocabulary RGB-T semantic segmentation model. Specifically, we obtain instance-level detection proposals by incorporating visual prompts to enhance category understanding. Additionally, we employ the CLIP model to assess image-text similarity, which helps correct semantic consistency and mitigates ambiguities in category identification. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Open-RGBT achieves superior performance in diverse and challenging real-world scenarios, even in the wild, significantly advancing the field of RGB-T semantic segmentation.

Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning, instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710 multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared data.

It consolidates five SOT tasks (RGB-based, RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, RGB-Event, RGB-Language Tracking) into a unified model trained in a single session. Due to the distinct nature of the data, current methods typically design individual architectures and train separate models for each task. This fragmentation results in redundant training processes, repetitive technological innovations, and limited cross-modal knowledge sharing. In contrast, SUTrack demonstrates that a single model with a unified input representation can effectively handle various common SOT tasks, eliminating the need for task-specific designs and separate training sessions. Additionally, we introduce a task-recognition auxiliary training strategy and a soft token type embedding to further enhance SUTrack's performance with minimal overhead. Experiments show that SUTrack outperforms previous task-specific counterparts across 11 datasets spanning five SOT tasks. Moreover, we provide a range of models catering edge devices as well as high-performance GPUs, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. We hope SUTrack could serve as a strong foundation for further compelling research into unified tracking models. Code and models are available at github.com/chenxin-dlut/SUTrack.

To address this gap, this work introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR), aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model, effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

This paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI, BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs. Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

This paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally, MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection, modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation. Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities, laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth (D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT), covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets, revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal categories when compared with RGB datasets.

We introduce Neural Thermodynamic Laws (NTL) -- a new framework that offers fresh insights into LLM training dynamics.

On the practical side, this scientific perspective yields intuitive guidelines for designing learning rate schedules.

HapticVLM leverages a ConvNeXt-based material recognition module to generate robust visual embeddings for accurate identification of object materials, while a state-of-the-art Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct) infers ambient temperature from environmental cues. The system synthesizes tactile sensations by delivering vibrotactile feedback through speakers and thermal cues via a Peltier module, thereby bridging the gap between visual perception and tactile experience. Experimental evaluations demonstrate an average recognition accuracy of 84.67% across five distinct auditory-tactile patterns and a temperature estimation accuracy of 86.7% based on a tolerance-based evaluation method with an 8Â°C margin of error across 15 scenarios. Although promising, the current study is limited by the use of a small set of prominent patterns and a modest participant pool. Future work will focus on expanding the range of tactile patterns and increasing user studies to further refine and validate the system's performance. Overall, HapticVLM presents a significant step toward context-aware, multimodal haptic interaction with potential applications in virtual reality, and assistive technologies.

While the finite element method (FEM) adopted by commercial software can provide accurate simulation results, it is very time- and memory-consuming for large-scale analysis. Over the past decade, the linear superposition method has been utilized to perform fast thermal stress estimations of TSV arrays, but it suffers from a lack of accuracy. In this paper, we propose MORE-Stress, a novel strict numerical algorithm for efficient thermal stress simulation of TSV arrays based on model order reduction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can realize a 153-504 times reduction in computational time and a 39-115 times reduction in memory usage compared with the commercial software ANSYS, with negligible errors less than 1%. Our algorithm is as efficient as the linear superposition method, with an order of magnitude smaller errors and fast convergence.

This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio, thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive multimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and modality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across various assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM while improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language reasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA and Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while reducing over 90% trainable parameters. We provide extensive analyses of CREMA, including the impact of each modality on reasoning domains, the design of the fusion module, and example visualizations.

Machine learning presents a rich opportunity to automatically process IoT data at scale, enabling efficient inference for understanding human wellbeing, controlling physical devices, and interconnecting smart cities. To realize this potential, we introduce IoT-LM, an open-source large multisensory language model tailored for the IoT ecosystem.

The second is a new multisensory multitask adapter layer to condition pre-trained large language models on multisensory IoT data. Not only does IoT-LM yield substantial improvements on 8 supervised IoT classification tasks, but it also demonstrates new interactive question-answering, reasoning, and dialog capabilities conditioned on IoT sensors.

This method relies on static parameter sets from extensive experimentation and simulations, hoping they remain stable and defect-free in production. Closed-loop control of LPBF can further enhance process stability and reduce defects despite complex thermal histories, process noise, hardware drift, and unexpected perturbations. Controller performance depends on parameter tuning, traditionally a manual, expertise-driven process with no guarantee of optimal performance and limited transferability between systems. This study proposes Bayesian Optimization (BO) to automate in-layer controller tuning by leveraging LPBF's layer-to-layer repetitive nature. Two approaches are introduced: online tuning, adjusting parameters iteratively during the process, and offline tuning, conducted in a setup such as laser exposures on a bare metal plate. These methods are experimentally implemented on an in-layer PI controller, and the performance is investigated on two wedge geometries prone to overheating. Results show that BO effectively tunes controllers using either method, significantly reducing overheating in controlled wedge specimens compared to uncontrolled ones. This study presents the first printed parts controlled by an in-layer controller subjected to microstructural analysis. Findings reveal partial presence of lack-of-fusion porosities due to insufficient laser power assigned by the controller, highlighting a significant challenge for utilizing laser power controllers. In summary, BO presents a promising method for automatic in-layer controller tuning in LPBF, enhancing control precision and mitigating overheating in production parts.

Commonly referred to as the `Internet of Things (IoT)' ecosystem, sensory data from motion, thermal, geolocation, depth, wireless signals, video, and audio are increasingly used to model the states of physical environments and the humans inside them. Despite the potential for understanding human wellbeing, controlling physical devices, and interconnecting smart cities, the community has seen limited benchmarks for building machine learning systems for IoT. Existing efforts are often specialized to a single sensory modality or prediction task, which makes it difficult to study and train large-scale models across many IoT sensors and tasks. To accelerate the development of new machine learning technologies for IoT, this paper proposes MultiIoT, the most expansive and unified IoT benchmark to date, encompassing over 1.15 million samples from 12 modalities and 8 real-world tasks. MultiIoT introduces unique challenges involving (1) generalizable learning from many sensory modalities, (2) multimodal interactions across long temporal ranges, (3) extreme heterogeneity due to unique structure and noise topologies in real-world sensors, and (4) complexity during training and inference. We evaluate a comprehensive set of models on MultiIoT, including modality and task-specific methods, multisensory and multitask supervised models, and large multisensory foundation models. Our results highlight opportunities for ML to make a significant impact in IoT, but many challenges in scalable learning from heterogeneous, long-range, and imperfect sensory modalities still persist. We release all code and data to accelerate future research in machine learning for IoT.

However, interpreting time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser, a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes, AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

To address the challenges posed by adversarial illumination conditions, the combination of thermal and visible images has demonstrated its advantages. However, existing fusion methods rely on the critical assumption that the RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) image pairs are fully overlapping. These assumptions often do not hold in real-world applications, where only partial overlap between images can occur due to sensors configuration. Moreover, sensor failure can cause loss of information in one modality. In this paper, we propose a novel module called the Hybrid Attention (HA) mechanism as our main contribution to mitigate performance degradation caused by partial overlap and sensor failure, i.e. when at least part of the scene is acquired by only one sensor. We propose an improved RGB-T fusion algorithm, robust against partial overlap and sensor failure encountered during inference in real-world applications. We also leverage a mobile-friendly backbone to cope with resource constraints in embedded systems. We conducted experiments by simulating various partial overlap and sensor failure scenarios to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superiority in handling real-world challenges.

The first one is an academic benchmark, the thermal block problem, where a Poisson equation is considered. Here a classic intrusive ROM framework based on a Galerkin projection scheme is employed. The second and third test cases come from real-world applications, the one related to the investigation of the blood flow patterns in a patient specific coronary arteries configuration where the Navier Stokes equations are addressed and the other one concerning the granulation process within pharmaceutical industry where a fluid-particle system is considered. Here we employ two data-driven ROM approaches showing a very relevant trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In the last part of the contribution, two novel technological platforms, ARGOS and ATLAS, are presented.

Existing methods mostly adopt a simple weight in the loss function to decide the information retention of each modality rather than adaptively measuring complementary information for different image pairs. In this study, we propose a multi-scale dual attention (MDA) framework for infrared and visible image fusion, which is designed to measure and integrate complementary information in both structure and loss function at the image and patch level. In our method, the residual downsample block decomposes source images into three scales first. Then, dual attention fusion block integrates complementary information and generates a spatial and channel attention map at each scale for feature fusion. Finally, the output image is reconstructed by the residual reconstruction block. Loss function consists of image-level, feature-level and patch-level three parts, of which the calculation of the image-level and patch-level two parts are based on the weights generated by the complementary information measurement. Indeed, to constrain the pixel intensity distribution between the output and infrared image, a style loss is added. Our fusion results perform robust and informative across different scenarios. Qualitative and quantitative results on two datasets illustrate that our method is able to preserve both thermal radiation and detailed information from two modalities and achieve comparable results compared with the other state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments show the effectiveness of our information integration architecture and adaptively measure complementary information retention in the loss function.

Early detection of faults is essential to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation, overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2. Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

Specifically, a semi-implicit formulation of the thermal Navier-Stokes equations is used to accelerate the simulations while maintaining accuracy. The SBM enables precise enforcement of field and derivative boundary conditions on cut (intercepted) elements, allowing for accurate flux calculations near complex geometries, when using non-boundary fitted meshes. Both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are implemented within the SBM framework, with results demonstrating that the SBM ensures precise enforcement of Neumann boundary conditions on Octree-based meshes. We illustrate this approach by simulating flows across different regimes, spanning several orders of magnitude in both the Rayleigh number ($Ra \sim 10^3$--$10^9$) and the Reynolds number ($Re \sim 10^0$--$10^4$), and covering the laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. Coupled thermal-flow phenomena and their statistics across all these regimes are accurately captured without any additional numerical treatments, beyond a Residual-based Variational Multiscale formulation (RB-VMS).

The VOT technology could be applied in various scenarios, processing data of diverse modalities such as RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud. Besides, since no one sensor could handle all the dynamic and varying environments, multi-modal VOT is also investigated. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent progress of both single-modal and multi-modal VOT, especially the deep learning methods. Specifically, we first review three types of mainstream single-modal VOT, including RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud tracking. In particular, we conclude four widely-used single-modal frameworks, abstracting their schemas and categorizing the existing inheritors. Then we summarize four kinds of multi-modal VOT, including RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, RGB-LiDAR and RGB-Language. Moreover, the comparison results in plenty of VOT benchmarks of the discussed modalities are presented. Finally, we provide recommendations and insightful observations, inspiring the future development of this fast-growing literature.

Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing. However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where ``X'', represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components. These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields. The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions. Notably, our proposed RoadFormer+ ranks first on the KITTI Road benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in mean intersection over union on the Cityscapes, MFNet, FMB, and ZJU datasets. Moreover, it reduces the number of learnable parameters by 65\% compared to RoadFormer. Our source code will be publicly available at mias.group/RoadFormerPlus.

ISTD aims to segment small target pixels from background. Most ISTD networks focus on designing feature extraction blocks or feature fusion modules, but rarely describe the ISTD process from the feature map evolution perspective. In the ISTD process, the network attention gradually shifts towards target areas. We abstract this process as the directional movement of feature map pixels to target areas through convolution, pooling and interactions with surrounding pixels, which can be analogous to the movement of thermal particles constrained by surrounding variables and particles. In light of this analogy, we propose Thermal Conduction-Inspired Transformer (TCI-Former) based on the theoretical principles of thermal conduction. According to thermal conduction differential equation in heat dynamics, we derive the pixel movement differential equation (PMDE) in the image domain and further develop two modules: Thermal Conduction-Inspired Attention (TCIA) and Thermal Conduction Boundary Module (TCBM). TCIA incorporates finite difference method with PMDE to reach a numerical approximation so that target body features can be extracted. To further remove errors in boundary areas, TCBM is designed and supervised by boundary masks to refine target body features with fine boundary details. Experiments on IRSTD-1k and NUAA-SIRST demonstrate the superiority of our method.

However, understanding this problem is far from straightforward due to the inherent differences between the terrestrial infrastructure and the satellite platform in space. In this paper, we take an important step towards closing this knowledge gap by presenting the first measurement study on the thermal control, power management, and performance of COTS computing devices on satellites. Our measurements reveal that the satellite platform and COTS computing devices significantly interplay in terms of the temperature and energy, forming the main constraints on satellite computing. Further, we analyze the critical factors that shape the characteristics of onboard COTS computing devices. We provide guidelines for future research on optimizing the use of such devices for computing purposes. Finally, we have released the datasets to facilitate further study in satellite computing.

However, their potential for safety and privacy violations is an increasing issue and highly limits their broader applications, underscoring the critical importance of UAV perception and defense (anti-UAV). Still, previous works have simplified such an anti-UAV task as a tracking problem, where the prior information of UAVs is always provided; such a scheme fails in real-world anti-UAV tasks (i.e. complex scenes, indeterminate-appear and -reappear UAVs, and real-time UAV surveillance). In this paper, we first formulate a new and practical anti-UAV problem featuring the UAVs perception in complex scenes without prior UAVs information. To benchmark such a challenging task, we propose the largest UAV dataset dubbed AntiUAV600 and a new evaluation metric. The AntiUAV600 comprises 600 video sequences of challenging scenes with random, fast, and small-scale UAVs, with over 723K thermal infrared frames densely annotated with bounding boxes. Finally, we develop a novel anti-UAV approach via an evidential collaboration of global UAVs detection and local UAVs tracking, which effectively tackles the proposed problem and can serve as a strong baseline for future research. Extensive experiments show our method outperforms SOTA approaches and validate the ability of AntiUAV600 to enhance UAV perception performance due to its large scale and complexity. Our dataset, pretrained models, and source codes will be released publically.

Traditional additive manufacturing simulations are very compute-intensive and are not scalable to simulate even moderately sized geometries. In this paper, we propose a general framework for creating a digital twin of the dynamic printing process by performing physics simulations with the intermediate print geometries. Our framework takes a general extrusion-based additive manufacturing G-code, generates an analysis-suitable voxelized geometry representation from the print schedule, and performs physics-based (transient thermal) simulations of the printing process. Our approach leverages adaptive octree meshes for both geometry representation as well as for fast simulations to address real-time predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by simulating the printing of complex geometries at high voxel resolutions with both sparse and dense infills. Our results show that this approach scales to high voxel resolutions and can predict the transient heat distribution as the print progresses. Because the simulation runs faster than real print time, the same engine could, in principle, feed thermal predictions back to the machine controller (e.g., to adjust fan speed or extrusion rate). The present study establishes the computational foundations for a real-time digital twin, which can be used for closed control loop control in the future.

However, these modalities operate at varying rates, posing challenges for real-time, comprehensive driver state monitoring. This paper addresses the issue of missing data due to sensor frame rate mismatches, introducing a generative model approach to create synthetic yet realistic thermal imagery. We propose using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), specifically comparing the pix2pix and CycleGAN architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that pix2pix outperforms CycleGAN, and utilizing multi-view input styles, especially stacked views, enhances the accuracy of thermal image generation. Moreover, the study evaluates the model's generalizability across different subjects, revealing the importance of individualized training for optimal performance. The findings suggest the potential of generative models in addressing missing frames, advancing driver state monitoring for intelligent vehicles, and underscoring the need for continued research in model generalization and customization.

However, real-world drone-viewed RGBT data suffers from the prominent position shift problem, i.e., the position of a tiny object differs greatly in different modalities. For instance, a slight deviation of a tiny object in the thermal modality will induce it to drift from the main body of itself in the RGB modality. Considering RGBT data are usually labeled on one modality (reference), this will cause the unlabeled modality (sensed) to lack accurate supervision signals and prevent the detector from learning a good representation. Moreover, the mismatch of the corresponding feature point between the modalities will make the fused features confusing for the detection head. In this paper, we propose to cast the cross-modality box shift issue as the label noise problem and address it on the fly via a novel Mean Teacher-based Cross-modality Box Correction head ensemble (CBC). In this way, the network can learn more informative representations for both modalities. Furthermore, to alleviate the feature map mismatch problem in RGBT fusion, we devise a Shifted Window-Based Cascaded Alignment (SWCA) module. SWCA mines long-range dependencies between the spatially unaligned features inside shifted windows and cascaded aligns the sensed features with the reference ones. Extensive experiments on two drone-based RGBT object detection datasets demonstrate that the correction results are both visually and quantitatively favorable, thereby improving the detection performance. In particular, our CBC module boosts the precision of the sensed modality ground truth by 25.52 aSim points. Overall, the proposed detector achieves an mAP_50 of 43.55 points on RGBTDronePerson and surpasses a state-of-the-art method by 8.6 mAP50 on a shift subset of DroneVehicle dataset. The code and data will be made publicly available.

However, the majority of existing studies have relied on symmetric duplex encoders for heterogeneous feature extraction and fusion, paying inadequate attention to the inherent differences between RGB and thermal modalities. Recent progress in vision foundation models (VFMs) trained through self-supervision on vast amounts of unlabeled data has proven their ability to extract informative, general-purpose features. However, this potential has yet to be fully leveraged in the domain. In this study, we take one step toward this new research area by exploring a feasible strategy to fully exploit VFM features for RGB-thermal scene parsing. Specifically, we delve deeper into the unique characteristics of RGB and thermal modalities, thereby designing a hybrid, asymmetric encoder that incorporates both a VFM and a convolutional neural network. This design allows for more effective extraction of complementary heterogeneous features, which are subsequently fused in a dual-path, progressive manner. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary task to further enrich the local semantics of the fused features, thereby improving the overall performance of RGB-thermal scene parsing. Our proposed HAPNet, equipped with all these components, demonstrates superior performance compared to all other state-of-the-art RGB-thermal scene parsing networks, achieving top ranks across three widely used public RGB-thermal scene parsing datasets. We believe this new paradigm has opened up new opportunities for future developments in data-fusion scene parsing approaches.

Nowadays, most Stencil-driven scientific computing still relies heavily on supercomputers, suffering from expensive access, poor scalability, and duplicated optimizations.
  This paper proposes Tetris, the first system for high-performance Stencil on heterogeneous CPU+GPU, towards democratizing Stencil-driven scientific computing on Cloud. In Tetris, polymorphic tiling tetrominoes are first proposed to bridge different hardware architectures and various application contexts with a perfect spatial and temporal tessellation automatically. Tetris is contributed by three main components: (1) Underlying hardware characteristics are first captured to achieve a sophisticated Pattern Mapping by register-level tetrominoes; (2) An efficient Locality Enhancer is first presented for data reuse on spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously by cache/SMEM-level tetrominoes; (3) A novel Concurrent Scheduler is first designed to exploit the full potential of on-cloud memory and computing power by memory-level tetrominoes. Tetris is orthogonal to (and complements) the optimizations or deployments for a wide variety of emerging and legacy scientific computing applications. Results of thermal diffusion simulation demonstrate that the performance is improved by 29.6x, reducing time cost from day to hour, while preserving the original accuracy.

These patches were initially designed to deceive single-modal detectors (e.g., visible or infrared) and have recently been extended to target visible-infrared dual-modal detectors. However, existing dual-modal adversarial patch attacks have limited attack effectiveness across diverse physical scenarios. To address this, we propose CDUPatch, a universal cross-modal patch attack against visible-infrared object detectors across scales, views, and scenarios. Specifically, we observe that color variations lead to different levels of thermal absorption, resulting in temperature differences in infrared imaging. Leveraging this property, we propose an RGB-to-infrared adapter that maps RGB patches to infrared patches, enabling unified optimization of cross-modal patches. By learning an optimal color distribution on the adversarial patch, we can manipulate its thermal response and generate an adversarial infrared texture. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale clipping strategy and construct a new visible-infrared dataset, MSDrone, which contains aerial vehicle images in varying scales and perspectives. These data augmentation strategies enhance the robustness of our patch in real-world conditions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (e.g., DroneVehicle, LLVIP, VisDrone, MSDrone) show that our method outperforms existing patch attacks in the digital domain. Extensive physical tests further confirm strong transferability across scales, views, and scenarios.

While harvesting environmental energy has long been necessary for small-scale embedded systems without access to external power sources, it is also increasingly important in designing sustainable larger-scale systems for edge applications. For sustained operations, such systems must consider not only the electrical energy but also the thermal energy available in the environment in their design and operation. Unfortunately, prior work generally ignores the impact of thermal effects, and instead implicitly assumes ideal temperatures. To address the problem, we develop a thermodynamic model that captures the interplay of electrical and thermal energy in environmentally-powered computer systems. The model captures the effect of environmental conditions, the system's physical properties, and workload scheduling on performance. In evaluating our model, we distill the thermal effects that impact these systems using a small-scale prototype and a programmable incubator. We then leverage our model to show how considering these thermal effects in designing and operating environmentally-powered computer systems of varying scales can improve their energy-efficiency, performance, and availability.

However, few studies have explored the safety of infrared imaging systems in real-world settings. Previous research has used physical perturbations such as small bulbs and thermal "QR codes" to attack infrared imaging detectors, but such methods are highly visible and lack stealthiness. Other researchers have used hot and cold blocks to deceive infrared imaging detectors, but this method is limited in its ability to execute attacks from various angles. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel physical attack called adversarial infrared blocks (AdvIB). By optimizing the physical parameters of the adversarial infrared blocks, this method can execute a stealthy black-box attack on thermal imaging system from various angles. We evaluate the proposed method based on its effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. Our physical tests show that the proposed method achieves a success rate of over 80% under most distance and angle conditions, validating its effectiveness. For stealthiness, our method involves attaching the adversarial infrared block to the inside of clothing, enhancing its stealthiness. Additionally, we test the proposed method on advanced detectors, and experimental results demonstrate an average attack success rate of 51.2%, proving its robustness. Overall, our proposed AdvIB method offers a promising avenue for conducting stealthy, effective and robust black-box attacks on thermal imaging system, with potential implications for real-world safety and security applications.

However, these methods usually adopt the standard full fine-tuning paradigm, which requires the optimization of considerable backbone parameters, causing extensive computational and storage requirements. In this work, we propose an efficient prompt-tuning framework tailored for multi-modal object re-identification, dubbed DMPT, which freezes the main backbone and only optimizes several newly added decoupled modality-aware parameters. Specifically, we explicitly decouple the visual prompts into modality-specific prompts which leverage prior modality knowledge from a powerful text encoder and modality-independent semantic prompts which extract semantic information from multi-modal inputs, such as visible, near-infrared, and thermal-infrared. Built upon the extracted features, we further design a Prompt Inverse Bind (PromptIBind) strategy that employs bind prompts as a medium to connect the semantic prompt tokens of different modalities and facilitates the exchange of complementary multi-modal information, boosting final re-identification results. Experimental results on multiple common benchmarks demonstrate that our DMPT can achieve competitive results to existing state-of-the-art methods while requiring only 6.5% fine-tuning of the backbone parameters.

We first present a vehicle and powertrain model, with emphasis on the electric motor model. We construct the latter by formulating the analytical scaling laws for AFMs, based on the scaling concept of RFMs from the literature, specifically deriving the model of the main loss component in electric motors: the copper losses. We further present separate scaling models of motor parameters, losses and thermal models, as well as the torque limits and cost, as a function of the design variables. Second, we validate these scaling laws with several experiments leveraging high-fidelity finite-element simulations. Finally, we define an optimization problem that minimizes the energy consumption over a drive cycle, optimizing the motor size and transmission ratio for a wide range of electric vehicle powertrain topologies. In our study, we observe that the all-wheel drive topology equipped with in-wheel AFMs is the most efficient, but also generates the highest material cost.

This study investigates whether MLLMs can understand complex images from RGB and thermal cameras and detect objects directly. Our goals were to 1) assess the ability of the MLLM to learn from information from various sets, 2) detect objects and identify elements in thermal cameras, 3) determine whether two independent modality images show the same scene, and 4) learn all objects using different modalities. The findings showed that both GPT-4 and Gemini were effective in detecting and classifying objects in thermal images. Similarly, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for pedestrian classification was 70.39% and 81.48%, respectively. Moreover, the MAPE for bike, car, and motorcycle detection were 78.4%, 55.81%, and 96.15%, respectively. Gemini produced MAPE of 66.53%, 59.35% and 78.18% respectively. This finding further demonstrates that MLLM can identify thermal images and can be employed in advanced imaging automation technologies for ITS applications.

Higher integration density, compounded with the slowdown of technology-driven power reduction, implies that power and thermal management become increasingly relevant. Unfortunately, existing research lacks a detailed analysis and modeling of thermal, power, and electrical coupling effects and how they have to be jointly considered to perform dynamic control of complex and heterogeneous Multi-Processor System on Chips (MPSoCs). To close the gap, in this work, we first provide a detailed thermal and power model targeting a modern High Performance Computing (HPC) MPSoC. We consider real-world coupling effects such as actuators' non-idealities and the exponential relation between the dissipated power, the temperature state, and the voltage level in a single processing element. We analyze how these factors affect the control algorithm behavior and the type of challenges that they pose. Based on the analysis, we propose a thermal capping strategy inspired by Fuzzy control theory to replace the state-of-the-art PID controller, as well as a root-finding iterative method to optimally choose the shared voltage value among cores grouped in the same voltage domain. We evaluate the proposed controller with model-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop co-simulations. We show an improvement over state-of-the-art methods of up to 5x the maximum exceeded temperature while providing an average of 3.56% faster application execution runtime across all the evaluation scenarios.

Overcoming this limitation, thermal infrared cameras have emerged as a solution, offering improved visibility and shape information for transparent objects. In this paper, we present TRansPose, the first large-scale multispectral dataset that combines stereo RGB-D, thermal infrared (TIR) images, and object poses to promote transparent object research. The dataset includes 99 transparent objects, encompassing 43 household items, 27 recyclable trashes, 29 chemical laboratory equivalents, and 12 non-transparent objects. It comprises a vast collection of 333,819 images and 4,000,056 annotations, providing instance-level segmentation masks, ground-truth poses, and completed depth information. The data was acquired using a FLIR A65 thermal infrared (TIR) camera, two Intel RealSense L515 RGB-D cameras, and a Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator. Spanning 87 sequences, TRansPose covers various challenging real-life scenarios, including objects filled with water, diverse lighting conditions, heavy clutter, non-transparent or translucent containers, objects in plastic bags, and multi-stacked objects.

Thereby, the lower level computes the minimum-stint-time for a given charge time and stint length, whilst the upper level leverages that information to jointly optimize the stint length, charge time and number of pit stops, in order to maximize the driven distance in the course of a fixed-time endurance race. Specifically, we first extend a convex lap time optimization framework to capture low-level vehicle dynamics and thermal models, and use it to create a map linking the charge time and stint length to the achievable stint time. Second, we leverage the map to frame the maximum-race-distance problem as a mixed-integer second order conic program that can be efficiently solved in a few seconds to the global optimum with off-the-shelf optimization algorithms. Finally, we showcase our framework for a simulated 6h race around the Zandvoort circuit. Our results show that the optimal race strategy can involve partially charging the battery, and that, compared to the case where the stints are optimized for a fixed number of pit stops, jointly optimizing the stints and number of pit stops can significantly increase the driven distance and hence race performance by several laps.

Existing methods mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently, state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.

We present DarwinWafer, a hyperscale system-on-wafer that replaces off-chip interconnects with wafer-scale, high-density integration of 64 Darwin3 chiplets on a 300 mm silicon interposer. A GALS NoC within each chiplet and an AER-based asynchronous wafer fabric with hierarchical time-step synchronization provide low-latency, coherent operation across the wafer. Each chiplet implements 2.35 M neurons and 0.1 B synapses, yielding 0.15 B neurons and 6.4 B synapses per wafer.At 333 MHz and 0.8 V, DarwinWafer consumes ~100 W and achieves 4.9 pJ/SOP, with 64 TSOPS peak throughput (0.64 TSOPS/W). Realization is enabled by a holistic chiplet-interposer co-design flow (including an in-house interposer-bump planner with early SI/PI and electro-thermal closure) and a warpage-tolerant assembly that fans out I/O via PCBlets and compliant pogo-pin connections, enabling robust, demountable wafer-to-board integration. Measurements confirm 10 mV supply droop and a uniform thermal profile (34-36 °C) under ~100 W. Application studies demonstrate whole-brain simulations: two zebrafish brains per chiplet with high connectivity fidelity (Spearman r = 0.896) and a mouse brain mapped across 32 chiplets (r = 0.645). To our knowledge, DarwinWafer represents a pioneering demonstration of wafer-scale neuromorphic computing, establishing a viable and scalable path toward large-scale, brain-like computation on silicon by replacing PCB-level interconnects with high-density, on-wafer integration.

One of the solutions is to heat the satellite when it is not exposed to sunlight, which could protect the satellites from extremely low temperatures. However, heat dissipation is necessary for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to operate properly and efficiently. In this way, this paper investigates the use of GPU as a means of passive heating in low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Our approach uses GPUs to generate heat during the eclipse phase of satellite orbits, substituting traditional heating systems, while the GPUs are also cooled down during this process. The results highlight the potential advantages and limitations of this method, including the cost implications, operational restrictions, and the technical complexity involved. Also, this paper explores the thermal behavior of GPUs under different computational loads, specifically focusing on execution-dominated and FLOP-dominated workloads. Moreover, this paper discusses future directions for improving GPU-based heating solutions, including further cost analysis, system optimization, and practical testing in real satellite missions.

While experimental data on certain state variables may be available, integrating these data with numerical solvers remains a significant challenge. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promising results in various engineering disciplines, particularly in handling noisy data and solving inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their effectiveness in forecasting nonlinear phenomena in multiphysics regimes, particularly involving turbulence, is yet to be fully established. This study introduces NeuroSEM, a hybrid framework integrating PINNs with the high-fidelity Spectral Element Method (SEM) solver, Nektar++. NeuroSEM leverages the strengths of both PINNs and SEM, providing robust solutions for multiphysics problems. PINNs are trained to assimilate data and model physical phenomena in specific subdomains, which are then integrated into the Nektar++ solver. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of NeuroSEM for thermal convection in cavity flow and flow past a cylinder. We applied NeuroSEM to the Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection system, including cases with missing thermal boundary conditions and noisy datasets, and to real particle image velocimetry (PIV) data to capture flow patterns characterized by horseshoe vortical structures. The framework's plug-and-play nature facilitates its extension to other multiphysics or multiscale problems. Furthermore, NeuroSEM is optimized for efficient execution on emerging integrated GPU-CPU architectures. This hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of simulations, making it a powerful tool for tackling complex engineering challenges in various scientific domains.

This includes modern techniques and technologies such as Additive Manufacturing (AM)/3D printing, as well as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the broader trend toward Industry 4.0. However, this adoption is not without risks: with a growing complexity and connectivity, so too grows the cyber-physical attack surface. Here, malicious actors might seek to steal sensitive information or sabotage products or production lines, causing financial and reputational loss. Of particular concern are where such malicious attacks may enter the complex supply chains of DM systems as Trojans -- malicious modifications that may trigger their payloads at later times or stages of the product lifecycle.
  In this work, we thus present a comprehensive overview of the threats posed by Trojans in Digital Manufacturing. We cover both hardware and software Trojans which may exist in products or their production and supply lines. From this, we produce a novel taxonomy for classifying and analyzing these threats, and elaborate on how different side channels (e.g. visual, thermal, acoustic, power, and magnetic) may be used to either enhance the impact of a given Trojan or utilized as part of a defensive strategy. Other defenses are also presented -- including hardware, web-, and software-related. To conclude, we discuss seven different case studies and elaborate how they fit into our taxonomy. Overall, this paper presents a detailed survey of the Trojan landscape for Digital Manufacturing: threats, defenses, and the importance of implementing secure practices.

Multi-sensor extrinsic calibration is one of the key factors of sensor fusion. However, such calibration is difficult due to the variety of sensor modalities and the requirement of calibration targets and human labor. In this paper, we demonstrate a new targetless cross-modal calibration framework by focusing on the extrinsic transformations among stereo cameras, thermal cameras, and laser sensors. Specifically, the calibration between stereo and laser is conducted in 3D space by minimizing the registration error, while the thermal extrinsic to the other two sensors is estimated by optimizing the alignment of the edge features. Our method requires no dedicated targets and performs the multi-sensor calibration in a single shot without human interaction. Experimental results show that the calibration framework is accurate and applicable in general scenes.

However, prior methods with common interpolations usually cannot provide accurate reconstruction performance as required. In addition, there exists no public dataset for widely research of reconstruction methods to further boost the reconstruction performance and engineering applications. To overcome this problem, this work develops a machine learning modelling benchmark for TFR-HSS task. First, the TFR-HSS task is mathematically modelled from real-world engineering problem and four types of numerically modellings have been constructed to transform the problem into discrete mapping forms. Then, this work proposes a set of machine learning modelling methods, including the general machine learning methods and the deep learning methods, to advance the state-of-the-art methods over temperature field reconstruction. More importantly, this work develops a novel benchmark dataset, namely Temperature Field Reconstruction Dataset (TFRD), to evaluate these machine learning modelling methods for the TFR-HSS task. Finally, a performance analysis of typical methods is given on TFRD, which can be served as the baseline results on this benchmark.

With their growing adoption in engineering design evaluation, a wide range of neural operator architectures have been proposed for various problem settings. However, model selection remains challenging due to the absence of fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address this, we propose and standardize six representative 3D industry-scale engineering design datasets spanning thermal analysis, linear elasticity, elasto-plasticity, time-dependent plastic problems, and computational fluid dynamics. All datasets include fully preprocessed inputs and outputs for model training, making them directly usable across diverse neural operator architectures. Using these datasets, we conduct a systematic comparison of four types of neural operator variants, including Branch-Trunk-based Neural Operators inspired by DeepONet, Graph-based Neural Operators inspired by Graph Neural Networks, Grid-based Neural Operators inspired by Fourier Neural Operators, and Point-based Neural Operators inspired by PointNet. We further introduce practical enhancements to adapt these models to different engineering settings, improving the fairness of the comparison. Our benchmarking study evaluates each model strengths and limitations in terms of predictive performance, computational efficiency, memory usage, and deployment complexity. The findings provide actionable insights to guide future neural operator development.

While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular, the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

However, most existing works on CBF synthesis focus on fully known settings. Synthesizing CBFs online based on perception data in unknown environments poses particular challenges. Specifically, this requires the construction of CBFs from high-dimensional data efficiently in real time. This paper proposes a new approach for online synthesis of CBFs directly from local Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs). Inspired by steady-state thermal fields, we show that the smoothness requirement of CBFs corresponds to the solution of the steady-state heat conduction equation with suitably chosen boundary conditions. By leveraging the sparsity of the coefficient matrix in Laplace's equation, our approach allows for efficient computation of safety values for each grid cell in the map. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the results show that our CBFs can be synthesized in an average of milliseconds on a 200 * 200 grid map, highlighting its real-time applicability.

In contrast to single-agent scenarios, collective decision-making encompasses group dynamics that may distort agents' preference feedback, thereby impeding their capacity to achieve a social-influence-free consensus -- the most preferable decision based on the aggregated agent utilities. We demonstrate that under mild rationality axioms, reaching social-influence-free consensus using noisy feedback alone is impossible. To address this, SBO employs a dual voting system: cheap but noisy public votes (e.g., show of hands in a meeting), and more accurate, though expensive, private votes (e.g., one-to-one interview). We model social influence using an unknown social graph and leverage the dual voting system to efficiently learn this graph. Our theoretical findigns show that social graph estimation converges faster than the black-box estimation of agents' utilities, allowing us to reduce reliance on costly private votes early in the process. This enables efficient consensus-building primarily through noisy public votes, which are debiased based on the estimated social graph to infer social-influence-free feedback. We validate the efficacy of SBO across multiple real-world applications, including thermal comfort, team building, travel negotiation, and energy trading collaboration.

Although modern reaction-diffusion models can predict the patterns resulting from unstable FP, the inverse design of patterns, which aims to retrieve process conditions that produce a desired pattern, remains an open challenge due to the non-unique and non-intuitive mapping between process conditions and manufactured patterns. In this work, we propose a probabilistic generative model named univariate conditional variational autoencoder (UcVAE) for the inverse design of hierarchical patterns in FP-based manufacturing. Unlike the cVAE, which encodes both the design space and the design target, the UcVAE encodes only the design space. In the encoder of the UcVAE, the number of training parameters is significantly reduced compared to the cVAE, resulting in a shorter training time while maintaining comparable performance. Given desired pattern images, the trained UcVAE can generate multiple process condition solutions that produce high-fidelity hierarchical patterns.

Traditional physical sensor systems face limitations such as installation challenges, high costs, and difficulty measuring critical parameters in hard-to-reach or harsh environments, often resulting in incomplete data coverage. Machine learning-driven virtual sensors, integrated within a digital twin framework, offer a transformative solution by enhancing physical sensor capabilities to monitor critical degradation indicators like pressure, velocity, and turbulence. However, conventional machine learning models struggle with real-time monitoring due to the high-dimensional nature of reactor data and the need for frequent retraining. This paper introduces the use of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) as a core component of a digital twin framework to predict key thermal-hydraulic parameters in the hot leg of an AP-1000 Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). DeepONet serves as a dynamic and scalable virtual sensor by accurately mapping the interplay between operational input parameters and spatially distributed system behaviors. In this study, DeepONet is trained with different operational conditions, which relaxes the requirement of continuous retraining, making it suitable for online and real-time prediction components for digital twin. Our results show that DeepONet achieves accurate predictions with low mean squared error and relative L2 error and can make predictions on unknown data 1400 times faster than traditional CFD simulations. This speed and accuracy enable DeepONet to synchronize with the physical system in real-time, functioning as a dynamic virtual sensor that tracks degradation-contributing conditions.

In this paper, two newly devised DeepONet formulations with sequential learning and Residual U-Net (ResUNet) architectures are trained for the first time to simultaneously predict complete thermal and mechanical solution fields under variable loading, loading histories, process parameters, and even variable geometries. Two real-world applications are demonstrated: 1- coupled thermo-mechanical analysis of steel continuous casting with multiple visco-plastic constitutive laws and 2- sequentially coupled direct energy deposition for additive manufacturing. Despite highly challenging spatially variable target stress distributions, DeepONets can infer reasonably accurate full-field temperature and stress solutions several orders of magnitude faster than traditional and highly optimized finite-element analysis (FEA), even when FEA simulations are run on the latest high-performance computing platforms. The proposed DeepONet model's ability to provide field predictions almost instantly for unseen input parameters opens the door for future preliminary evaluation and design optimization of these vital industrial processes.

Given their high energy consumption and exponentially large computational workloads, data centers are prime candidates for optimizing power consumption, especially in areas such as cooling and IT energy usage. A significant challenge in this pursuit is the lack of a configurable and scalable thermal data center model that offers an end-to-end pipeline. Data centers consist of multiple IT components whose geometric configuration and heat dissipation make thermal modeling difficult. This paper presents PyDCM, a customizable Data Center Model implemented in Python, that allows users to create unique configurations of IT equipment with custom server specifications and geometric arrangements of IT cabinets. The use of vectorized thermal calculations makes PyDCM orders of magnitude faster (30 times) than current Energy Plus modeling implementations and scales sublinearly with the number of CPUs. Also, PyDCM enables the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning via the Gymnasium wrapper to optimize data center cooling and offers a user-friendly platform for testing various data center design prototypes.

Despite many SLAM datasets have been released, current SLAM solutions still struggle to have sustained and resilient performance. One major issue is the absence of high-quality datasets including diverse all-weather conditions and a reliable metric for assessing robustness. This limitation significantly restricts the scalability and generalizability of SLAM technologies, impacting their development, validation, and deployment. To address this problem, we present SubT-MRS, an extremely challenging real-world dataset designed to push SLAM towards all-weather environments to pursue the most robust SLAM performance. It contains multi-degraded environments including over 30 diverse scenes such as structureless corridors, varying lighting conditions, and perceptual obscurants like smoke and dust; multimodal sensors such as LiDAR, fisheye camera, IMU, and thermal camera; and multiple locomotions like aerial, legged, and wheeled robots. We develop accuracy and robustness evaluation tracks for SLAM and introduced novel robustness metrics. Comprehensive studies are performed, revealing new observations, challenges, and opportunities for future research.

The advent of smart meters and smart grids provide an unprecedented advantage in realizing an optimised supply of thermal energies through proactive techniques such as load forecasting. In this paper, we propose a forecasting framework for heat demand based on neural networks where the time series are encoded as scalograms equipped with the capacity of embedding exogenous variables such as weather, and holiday/non-holiday. Subsequently, CNNs are utilized to predict the heat load multi-step ahead. Finally, the proposed framework is compared with other state-of-the-art methods, such as SARIMAX and LSTM. The quantitative results from retrospective experiments show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline method with real-world data acquired from Denmark. A minimal mean error of 7.54% for MAPE and 417kW for RMSE is achieved with the proposed framework in comparison to all other methods.

Additionally, unpredictable workloads and resource limitations lead to fluctuating performance and violated SLOs. To improve SLO compliance in DCCS, one possibility is to apply machine learning; however, the design choices are often left to the developer. To that extent, we provide a benchmark of Active Inference -- an emerging method from neuroscience -- against three established reinforcement learning algorithms (Deep Q-Network, Advantage Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization). We consider a realistic DCCS use case: an edge device running a video conferencing application alongside a WebSocket server streaming videos. Using one of the respective algorithms, we continuously monitor key performance metrics, such as latency and bandwidth usage, to dynamically adjust parameters -- including the number of streams, frame rate, and resolution -- to optimize service quality and user experience. To test algorithms' adaptability to constant system changes, we simulate dynamically changing SLOs and both instant and gradual data-shift scenarios, such as network bandwidth limitations and fluctuating device thermal states. Although the evaluated algorithms all showed advantages and limitations, our findings demonstrate that Active Inference is a promising approach for ensuring SLO compliance in DCCS, offering lower memory usage, stable CPU utilization, and fast convergence.

Most existing autonomy systems heavily rely on active sensing, e.g., LiDAR, RADAR, and Time-of-Flight sensors, or use (stereo) visible light imaging sensors, e.g., color cameras, to perceive environment geometry and semantics. In scenarios where fully passive perception is required and lighting conditions are degraded to an extent that visible light cameras fail to perceive, most downstream mobility tasks such as obstacle avoidance become impossible. To address such a challenge, this paper presents a Multi-Modal Passive Perception dataset, M2P2, to enable off-road mobility in low-light to no-light conditions. We design a multi-modal sensor suite including thermal, event, and stereo RGB cameras, GPS, two Inertia Measurement Units (IMUs), as well as a high-resolution LiDAR for ground truth, with a novel multi-sensor calibration procedure that can efficiently transform multi-modal perceptual streams into a common coordinate system. Our 10-hour, 32 km dataset also includes mobility data such as robot odometry and actions and covers well-lit, low-light, and no-light conditions, along with paved, on-trail, and off-trail terrain. Our results demonstrate that off-road mobility is possible through only passive perception in extreme low-light conditions using end-to-end learning and classical planning.

In agricultural settings, NeRFs can serve as digital twins, providing critical information about fruit detection for yield estimation and other important metrics for farmers. However, traditional NeRFs are not robust to challenging lighting conditions, such as low-light, extreme bright light and varying lighting. To address these issues, this work leverages three different sensors: an RGB camera, an event camera and a thermal camera. Our RGB scene reconstruction shows an improvement in PSNR and SSIM by +2.06 dB and +8.3% respectively. Our cross-spectral scene reconstruction enhances downstream fruit detection by +43.0% in mAP50 and +61.1% increase in mAP50-95. The integration of additional sensors leads to a more robust and informative NeRF. We demonstrate that our multi-modal system yields high quality photo-realistic reconstructions under various tree canopy covers and at different times of the day. This work results in the development of a resilient NeRF, capable of performing well in visibly degraded scenarios, as well as a learnt cross-spectral representation, that is used for automated fruit detection.

In this paper, we tackle the task by proposing an efficient and implementation-friendly computational method that can fully leverage the computing power offered by hardware accelerators, namely, graphical processing units (GPUs). We first employ the Two-Point Flux-Approximation scheme to discretize the PDE and then utilize the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve the resulting algebraic linear system. The construction of the preconditioner originates from FFT-based homogenization methods, and an engineered linear programming technique is utilized to determine the homogeneous reference parameters. The fundamental observation presented in this paper is that the preconditioner system can be effectively solved using multiple Fast Cosine Transformations (FCT) and parallel tridiagonal matrix solvers. Regarding the fact that default multiple FCTs are unavailable on the CUDA platform, we detail how to derive FCTs from FFTs with nearly optimal memory usage. Numerical experiments including the stability comparison with standard preconditioners are conducted for 3D RVEs. Our performance reports indicate that the proposed method can achieve a $5$-fold acceleration on the GPU platform over the pure CPU platform and solve the problems with $512^3$ degrees of freedom and reasonable contrast ratios in less than $30$ seconds.

However, the predominant reliance on RGB imaging presupposes ideal lighting conditions: a premise frequently unmet in robotic applications plagued by poor lighting or visual obstructions. This limitation overlooks the capabilities of infrared (IR) cameras, which excel in low-light detection and present a robust alternative under such adverse scenarios. To tackle these issues, we introduce Thermal-NeRF, the first method that estimates a volumetric scene representation in the form of a NeRF solely from IR imaging. By leveraging a thermal mapping and structural thermal constraint derived from the thermal characteristics of IR imaging, our method showcasing unparalleled proficiency in recovering NeRFs in visually degraded scenes where RGB-based methods fall short. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that Thermal-NeRF can achieve superior quality compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we contribute a dataset for IR-based NeRF applications, paving the way for future research in IR NeRF reconstruction.

To face these challenges, a holistic approach is essential that allows for the concurrent development of part design, material system and manufacturing process. Current approaches employ numerical simulations, which however quickly becomes computation-intensive, especially for iterative optimization. Data-driven machine learning methods can be used to replace time- and resource-intensive numerical simulations. In particular, MeshGraphNets (MGNs) have shown promising results. They enable fast and accurate predictions on unseen mesh geometries while being fully differentiable for optimization. However, these models rely on large amounts of expensive training data, such as numerical simulations. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer an opportunity to train neural networks with partial differential equations instead of labeled data, but have not been extended yet to handle time-dependent simulations of arbitrary meshes. This work introduces PI-MGNs, a hybrid approach that combines PINNs and MGNs to quickly and accurately solve non-stationary and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) on arbitrary meshes. The method is exemplified for thermal process simulations of unseen parts with inhomogeneous material distribution. Further results show that the model scales well to large and complex meshes, although it is trained on small generic meshes only.

Current multi-modal large language models, however, passively absorb sensory data as inputs, lacking the capacity to actively interact with the objects in the 3D environment and dynamically collect their multisensory information. To usher in the study of this area, we propose MultiPLY, a multisensory embodied large language model that could incorporate multisensory interactive data, including visual, audio, tactile, and thermal information into large language models, thereby establishing the correlation among words, actions, and percepts. To this end, we first collect Multisensory Universe, a large-scale multisensory interaction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied agent to engage with the 3D environment. To perform instruction tuning with pre-trained LLM on such generated data, we first encode the 3D scene as abstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens denoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment, as well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of the agent at each time step. In the inference time, MultiPLY could generate action tokens, instructing the agent to take the action in the environment and obtain the next multisensory state observation. The observation is then appended back to the LLM via state tokens to generate subsequent text or action tokens. We demonstrate that MultiPLY outperforms baselines by a large margin through a diverse set of embodied tasks involving object retrieval, tool use, multisensory captioning, and task decomposition.

These issues have been exacerbated by the emergence of data-intensive applications in recent years. Memories based on phase change materials (PCMs) offer promising solutions to these challenges. PCMs store data in the material's phase, which can shift between amorphous and crystalline states when external thermal energy is supplied. This is often achieved using electrical pulses. Alternatively, using laser pulses and integration with silicon photonics offers a unique opportunity to realize high-bandwidth and low-latency photonic memories. Such a memory system may in turn open the possibility of realizing fully photonic computing systems. But to realize photonic memories, several challenges that are unique to the photonic domain such as crosstalk, optical loss management, and laser power overhead have to be addressed. In this work, we present COMET, the first cross-layer optimized optical main memory architecture that uses PCMs. In architecting COMET, we explore how to use silicon photonics and PCMs together to design a large-scale main memory system while addressing associated challenges. We explore challenges and propose solutions at the PCM cell, photonic memory circuit, and memory architecture levels. Based on our evaluations, COMET offers 7.1x better bandwidth, 15.1x lower EPB, and 3x lower latencies than the best-known prior work on photonic main memory architecture design.

We propose an analysis-by-synthesis framework that jointly models the objects, people, and their thermal reflections, which allows us to combine generative models with differentiable rendering of reflections. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show our approach works in highly challenging cases, such as with curved mirrors or when the person is completely unseen by a normal camera.

They present a few technical challenges for battery management, a prominent one of which is the prediction of the power capability of their lithium-ion battery systems. The challenge originates from the high C-rate discharging conditions required during eVTOL flights as well as the complexity of lithium-ion batteries' electro-thermal dynamics. This paper, for the first time, formulates a power limit prediction problem for eVTOL which explicitly considers long prediction horizons and the possible occurrence of emergency landings. We then harness machine learning to solve this problem in two intertwined ways. First, we adopt a dynamic model that integrates physics with machine learning to predict a lithium-ion battery's voltage and temperature behaviors with high accuracy. Second, while performing search for the maximum power, we leverage machine learning to predict the remaining discharge time and use the prediction to accelerate the search with fast computation. Our validation results show the effectiveness of the proposed study for eVTOL operations.

However, persistent visual degradation, including smoke generated by energy devices, lens fogging from thermal gradients, and lens contamination due to blood or tissue fluid splashes during surgical procedures, severely impair visual clarity. These degenerations can seriously hinder surgical workflow and pose risks to patient safety. To systematically investigate and address various forms of surgical scene degradation, we introduce a real-world open-source surgical image restoration dataset covering laparoscopic environments, called SurgClean, which involves multi-type image restoration tasks, e.g., desmoking, defogging, and desplashing. SurgClean comprises 1,020 images with diverse degradation types and corresponding paired reference labels. Based on SurgClean, we establish a standardized evaluation benchmark and provide performance for 22 representative generic task-specific image restoration approaches, including 12 generic and 10 task-specific image restoration approaches. Experimental results reveal substantial performance gaps relative to clinical requirements, highlighting a critical opportunity for algorithm advancements in intelligent surgical restoration. Furthermore, we explore the degradation discrepancies between surgical and natural scenes from structural perception and semantic understanding perspectives, providing fundamental insights for domain-specific image restoration research.

Existing research primarily focuses on exploring spectral information from 2D compressive measurements and spatial information from PAN images in an explicit manner, leading to a bottleneck in HSI reconstruction. Various physical factors, such as temperature, emissivity, and multiple reflections between objects, play a critical role in the process of a sensor acquiring hyperspectral thermal signals. Inspired by this, we attempt to investigate the interrelationships between physical properties to provide deeper theoretical insights for HSI reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a Physics-Informed Cross-Modal State Space Model Network (PCMamba) for DCCHI, which incorporates the forward physical imaging process of HSI into the linear complexity of Mamba to facilitate lightweight and high-quality HSI reconstruction. Specifically, we analyze the imaging process of hyperspectral thermal signals to enable the network to disentangle the three key physical properties-temperature, emissivity, and texture. By fully exploiting the potential information embedded in 2D measurements and PAN images, the HSIs are reconstructed through a physics-driven synthesis process. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Scanning Mamba Block (CSMB) that introduces inter-modal pixel-wise interaction with positional inductive bias by cross-scanning the backbone features and PAN features. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and simulated datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.

However, their rarity results in highly imbalanced datasets, posing challenges for AI-based detection and severity quantification. We propose BetaMixer, a novel deep learning model that addresses these challenges through a Beta distribution-based mixing approach, converting discrete IAE severity scores into continuous values for precise severity regression (0-5 scale). BetaMixer employs Beta distribution-based sampling to enhance underrepresented classes and regularizes intermediate embeddings to maintain a structured feature space. A generative approach aligns the feature space with sampled IAE severity, enabling robust classification and severity regression via a transformer. Evaluated on the MultiBypass140 dataset, which we extended with IAE labels, BetaMixer achieves a weighted F1 score of 0.76, recall of 0.81, PPV of 0.73, and NPV of 0.84, demonstrating strong performance on imbalanced data. By integrating Beta distribution-based sampling, feature mixing, and generative modeling, BetaMixer offers a robust solution for IAE detection and quantification in clinical settings.

Although operator learning frameworks such as DeepOHeat have demonstrated promising preliminary results in accelerating thermal simulation, they face critical limitations in prediction capability for multi-scale thermal patterns, training efficiency, and trustworthiness of results during design optimization. This paper presents DeepOHeat-v1, an enhanced physics-informed operator learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with learnable activation functions as trunk networks, enabling an adaptive representation of multi-scale thermal patterns. This approach achieves a $1.25\times$ and $6.29\times$ reduction in error in two representative test cases. Second, we introduce a separable training method that decomposes the basis function along the coordinate axes, achieving $62\times$ training speedup and $31\times$ GPU memory reduction in our baseline case, and enabling thermal analysis at resolutions previously infeasible due to GPU memory constraints. Third, we propose a confidence score to evaluate the trustworthiness of the predicted results, and further develop a hybrid optimization workflow that combines operator learning with finite difference (FD) using Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method for incremental solution refinement, enabling efficient and trustworthy thermal optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepOHeat-v1 achieves accuracy comparable to optimization using high-fidelity finite difference solvers, while speeding up the entire optimization process by $70.6\times$ in our test cases, effectively minimizing the peak temperature through optimal placement of heat-generating components.

However, the field lacks a standardized workflow that encompasses prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, ML interpretability, and polymer synthesizability. In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density. The POINT$^{2}$ database can serve as a valuable resource for the polymer informatics community for polymer discovery and optimization.

Traditional encoder-decoder architectures, while designed for cross-modality feature interactions, may not have adequately considered the robustness against noise originating from defective modalities. Inspired by hierarchical human visual systems, we propose the ConTriNet, a robust Confluent Triple-Flow Network employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy. Specifically, ConTriNet comprises three flows: two modality-specific flows explore cues from RGB and Thermal modalities, and a third modality-complementary flow integrates cues from both modalities. ConTriNet presents several notable advantages. It incorporates a Modality-induced Feature Modulator in the modality-shared union encoder to minimize inter-modality discrepancies and mitigate the impact of defective samples. Additionally, a foundational Residual Atrous Spatial Pyramid Module in the separated flows enlarges the receptive field, allowing for the capture of multi-scale contextual information. Furthermore, a Modality-aware Dynamic Aggregation Module in the modality-complementary flow dynamically aggregates saliency-related cues from both modality-specific flows. Leveraging the proposed parallel triple-flow framework, we further refine saliency maps derived from different flows through a flow-cooperative fusion strategy, yielding a high-quality, full-resolution saliency map for the final prediction. To evaluate the robustness and stability of our approach, we collect a comprehensive RGB-T SOD benchmark, VT-IMAG, covering various real-world challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and our VT-IMAG dataset demonstrate that ConTriNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in both common and challenging scenarios.

However, internal defects such as porosity and cracks can compromise mechanical properties and overall performance. This study focuses on in-situ monitoring and characterization of melt pools associated with porosity, aiming to improve defect detection and quality control in DED-printed parts. Traditional machine learning approaches for defect identification rely on extensive labeled datasets, often scarce and expensive to generate in real-world manufacturing. To address this, our framework employs self-supervised learning on unlabeled melt pool data using a Vision Transformer-based Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to produce highly representative embeddings. These fine-tuned embeddings are leveraged via transfer learning to train classifiers on a limited labeled dataset, enabling the effective identification of melt pool anomalies. We evaluate two classifiers: (1) a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier utilizing the fine-tuned MAE Encoder's parameters and (2) the fine-tuned MAE Encoder combined with an MLP classifier head. Our framework achieves overall accuracy ranging from 95.44% to 99.17% and an average F1 score exceeding 80%, with the ViT Classifier slightly outperforming the MAE Encoder Classifier. This demonstrates the scalability and cost-effectiveness of our approach for automated quality control in DED, effectively detecting defects with minimal labeled data.

This paper presents a new coupled electro-thermal model for batteries and studies how to extract it from data. We consider the problem of maximum likelihood parameter estimation, which, however, is nontrivial to solve as the model is nonlinear in both its dynamics and measurement. We propose to leverage the Bayesian optimization approach, owing to its machine learning-driven capability in handling complex optimization problems and searching for global optima. To enhance the parameter search efficiency, we dynamically narrow and refine the search space in Bayesian optimization. The proposed system identification approach can efficiently determine the parameters of the coupled electro-thermal model. It is amenable to practical implementation, with few requirements on the experiment, data types, and optimization setups, and well applicable to many other battery models.

A crucial aspect in ensuring their safe and optimal performance is monitoring their energy levels. In this paper, we present the first study on predicting the remaining energy of a battery cell undergoing discharge over wide current ranges from low to high C-rates. The complexity of the challenge arises from the cell's C-rate-dependent energy availability as well as its intricate electro-thermal dynamics especially at high C-rates. To address this, we introduce a new definition of remaining discharge energy and then undertake a systematic effort in harnessing the power of machine learning to enable its prediction. Our effort includes two parts in cascade. First, we develop an accurate dynamic model based on integration of physics with machine learning to capture a battery's voltage and temperature behaviors. Second, based on the model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the remaining discharge energy under arbitrary C-rates and pre-specified cut-off limits in voltage and temperature. The experimental validation shows that the proposed approach can predict the remaining discharge energy with a relative error of less than 3% when the current varies between 0~8 C for an NCA cell and 0~15 C for an LFP cell. The approach, by design, is amenable to training and computation.

A control-oriented thermal-NDC (nonlinear double-capacitor) battery model is proposed to describe the electrical and thermal dynamics, incorporating the effects of both an active thermal source and ambient temperature. A state-feedback model predictive control algorithm is then developed for optimal fast charging and active thermal management. Numerical experiments validate the algorithm under extreme temperatures, showing that the proposed algorithm can energy-efficiently adjust the battery temperature, thereby balancing charging speed and battery health. Additionally, an output-feedback model predictive control algorithm with an extended Kalman filter is proposed for battery charging when states are partially measurable. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness under extreme temperatures.

This paper introduces a novel DeePODE method, which consists of an Evolutionary Monte Carlo Sampling method (EMCS) and an efficient end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) to predict multiscale dynamical systems. We validate this finding across dynamical systems from ecological systems to reactive flows, including a predator-prey model, a power system oscillation, a battery electrolyte thermal runaway, and turbulent reaction-diffusion systems with complex chemical kinetics. The method demonstrates robust generalization capabilities, allowing pre-trained DNN models to accurately predict the behavior in previously unseen scenarios, largely due to the delicately constructed dataset. While theoretical guarantees remain to be established, empirical evidence shows that DeePODE achieves the accuracy of implicit numerical schemes while maintaining the computational efficiency of explicit schemes. This work underscores the crucial relationship between training data distribution and neural network generalization performance.

This limits the network's ability to adapt to the diverse dual-modality appearances of targets and the dynamic relationships between the modalities. Additionally, the three-stage fusion tracking paradigm followed by these networks significantly restricts the tracking speed. To overcome these problems, we propose a unified single-stage Transformer RGB-T tracking network, namely USTrack, which unifies the above three stages into a single ViT (Vision Transformer) backbone with a dual embedding layer through self-attention mechanism. With this structure, the network can extract fusion features of the template and search region under the mutual interaction of modalities. Simultaneously, relation modeling is performed between these features, efficiently obtaining the search region fusion features with better target-background discriminability for prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a novel feature selection mechanism based on modality reliability to mitigate the influence of invalid modalities for prediction, further improving the tracking performance. Extensive experiments on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the fastest inference speed 84.2FPS. In particular, MPR/MSR on the short-term and long-term subsets of VTUAV dataset increased by 11.1$\%$/11.7$\%$ and 11.3$\%$/9.7$\%$.

The Frobenius matrix norm is used to evaluate the accuracy of the X-PINN predictions and the results show excellent performance. In addition, symbolic regression is employed to determine the closed form of the unknown part of the equation from the data, and the results confirm the accuracy of the X-PINNs based approach. To test the framework in a situation resembling real-world data, random noise is added to the datasets to mimic scenarios such as the presence of thermal noise or instrument errors. The results show that the framework is stable against significant amount of noise. As the final part, we determine the minimal amount of data required for training the neural network. The framework is able to predict the correct form and coefficients of the underlying dynamical equation when at least 50\% data is used for training.

Thermal optimization of 3D IC often requires massive expensive PDE simulations. Neural network-based thermal prediction models can perform real-time prediction for many unseen new designs. However, existing works either solve 2D temperature fields only or do not generalize well to new designs with unseen design configurations (e.g., heat sources and boundary conditions). In this paper, for the first time, we propose DeepOHeat, a physics-aware operator learning framework to predict the temperature field of a family of heat equations with multiple parametric or non-parametric design configurations. This framework learns a functional map from the function space of multiple key PDE configurations (e.g., boundary conditions, power maps, heat transfer coefficients) to the function space of the corresponding solution (i.e., temperature fields), enabling fast thermal analysis and optimization by changing key design configurations (rather than just some parameters). We test DeepOHeat on some industrial design cases and compare it against Celsius 3D from Cadence Design Systems. Our results show that, for the unseen testing cases, a well-trained DeepOHeat can produce accurate results with $1000\times$ to $300000\times$ speedup.

Considering patient monitoring in particular, in-bed human posture estimation offers important health-related metrics with potential value in medical condition assessments. Despite great progress in this domain, it remains challenging due to substantial ambiguity during occlusions, and the lack of large corpora of manually labeled data for model training, particularly with domains such as thermal infrared imaging which are privacy-preserving, and thus of great interest. Motivated by the effectiveness of self-supervised methods in learning features directly from data, we propose a multi-modal conditional variational autoencoder (MC-VAE) capable of reconstructing features from missing modalities seen during training. This approach is used with HRNet to enable single modality inference for in-bed pose estimation. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that body positions can be effectively recognized from the available modality, achieving on par results with baseline models that are highly dependent on having access to multiple modes at inference time. The proposed framework supports future research towards self-supervised learning that generates a robust model from a single source, and expects it to generalize over many unknown distributions in clinical environments.

However, these PEFT-based RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features. Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally, unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our method demonstrates outstanding performance.

The system significantly increases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by transmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital ones. This improvement, however, comes at the cost of channel-induced distortions, such as fading and noise, which affect the aggregated global parameters. To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in large-scale client scenarios. Our analysis reveals three key advantages of scaling up the number of participating clients: (1) Enhanced Privacy: The mutual information between a client's local gradient and the server's aggregated gradient diminishes, effectively reducing privacy leakage. (2) Mitigation of Channel Fading: The channel hardening effect eliminates the impact of small-scale fading in the noisy global gradient. (3) Improved Convergence: Reduced thermal noise and gradient estimation errors benefit the convergence rate. These findings solidify over-the-air model training as a viable approach for federated learning in networks with a large number of clients. The theoretical insights are further substantiated through extensive experimental evaluations.

Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as a promising solution for AI inference, leveraging technologies such as ReRAM, SRAM, and FeFET, each offering unique advantages and trade-offs. A heterogeneous chiplet-based PIM architecture can harness the complementary strengths of these technologies to enable higher performance and energy efficiency. However, scheduling AI workloads across such a heterogeneous system is challenging due to competing performance objectives, dynamic workload characteristics, and power and thermal constraints. To address this need, we propose THERMOS, a thermally-aware, multi-objective scheduling framework for AI workloads on heterogeneous multi-chiplet PIM architectures. THERMOS trains a single multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) policy that is capable of achieving Pareto-optimal execution time, energy, or a balanced objective at runtime, depending on the target preferences. Comprehensive evaluations show that THERMOS achieves up to 89% faster average execution time and 57% lower average energy consumption than baseline AI workload scheduling algorithms with only 0.14% runtime and 0.022% energy overhead.

These advantages result in lower energy per bit, higher communication frequencies, and extended interconnect range. However, deformation of the package (warpage) in glass interposer-based systems becomes a critical challenge as system size increases, leading to severe mechanical stress and reliability concerns. Beyond a certain size, conventional packaging techniques fail to manage warpage effectively, necessitating new approaches to mitigate warpage induced bending with scalable performance for glass interposer based multi-chiplet systems. To address these inter-twined challenges, we propose a thermal-, warpage-, and performance-aware design framework that employs architecture and packaging co-optimization. The proposed framework disintegrates the surface and embedded chiplets to balance conflicting design objectives, ensuring optimal trade-offs between performance, power, and structural reliability. Our experiments demonstrate that optimized multi-chiplet architectures from our design framework achieve up to 64.7% performance improvement and 40% power reduction compared to traditional 2.5D systems to execute deep neural network workloads with lower fabrication costs.

However, its inherent high leakage currents, which lead to low piezoelectric response and poor temperature stability, have severely limited its practical applications. In this study, lead free piezoelectric ceramics of the 0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3 (BF-BT) system were prepared, and their microstructures along with high-temperature electrical performance were modulated by introducing Nd3+. The results indicate that moderate Nd doping improves lattice symmetry and reduces oxygen vacancy-related defect dipoles, thereby effectively suppressing leakage currents at temperatures above 75Â°C. The Nddoped samples exhibit significantly lower leakage current densities, reduced by over 99% compared to the undoped ceramics, reaching values as low as 10-5Acm-2. They also show higher resistivity under elevated temperatures and electric fields, offering notable improvements in thermal stability over the undoped counterparts. In addition, the Nd-doped samples achieved piezoelectric coefficients as high as 172 pC N -1 at room temperature while still maintaining high dielectric and piezoelectric responses at elevated temperatures. This work not only provides an effective way to solve the leakage current problem of BF-BT ceramics in high temperature applications but also indicates a new design strategy for optimizing the high temperature stability of lead free piezoelectric materials, which shows a broad application prospect in the field of high-temperature sensors and actuators.

It is widely believed that integrating the thermal flexibility of buildings into the distribution system can improve the operating economy and reliability of the system. However, the private information of the buildings needs to be transferred to the distribution system operator (DSO) to achieve a coordinated optimization, bringing serious privacy concerns to users. Given this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserved optimal dispatch approach for the distribution system incorporating buildings. Using it, the DSO can exploit the thermal flexibility of buildings without accessing their private information, such as model parameters and indoor temperature profiles. Specifically, we first develop an optimal dispatch model for the distribution system integrating buildings, which can be extended to other storage-like flexibility resources. Second, we reveal that the privacy-preserved integration of buildings is a joint privacy preservation problem for both parameters and state variables and then design a privacy-preserved algorithm based on transformation-based encryption, constraint relaxation, and constraint extension techniques. Besides, we implement a detailed privacy analysis for the proposed method, considering both semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Case studies demonstrate the accuracy, privacy-preserved performance, and computational efficiency of the proposed method.

Human factors, such as ergonomics, safety, and well-being, push the human-centric smart factory to efficiently adopt novel technologies while minimizing environmental and social impact. As operations at the factory floor increasingly rely on collaborative robots (CoBots) and flexible manufacturing systems, there is a growing demand for redundant safety mechanisms (i.e., automatic human detection in the proximity of machinery that is under operation). Fostering enhanced process safety for human proximity detection allows for the protection against possible incidents or accidents with the deployed industrial devices and machinery. This paper introduces the design and implementation of a cost-effective thermal imaging Safety Sensor that can be used in the scope of Industry 5.0 to trigger distinct safe mode states in manufacturing processes that rely on collaborative robotics. The proposed Safety Sensor uses a hybrid detection approach and has been evaluated under controlled environmental conditions. The obtained results show a 97% accuracy at low computational cost when using the developed hybrid method to detect the presence of humans in thermal images.

Heterogeneous integration of smaller chiplets using a 2.5D silicon interposer and 3D packaging has emerged as a promising paradigm to address this limit and meet performance demands. These approaches offer a significant cost reduction and higher manufacturing yield than monolithic 2D integrated circuits. However, the compact arrangement and high compute density exacerbate the thermal management challenges, potentially compromising performance. Addressing these thermal modeling challenges is critical, especially as system sizes grow and different design stages require varying levels of accuracy and speed. Since no single thermal modeling technique meets all these needs, this paper introduces MFIT, a range of multi-fidelity thermal models that effectively balance accuracy and speed. These multi-fidelity models can enable efficient design space exploration and runtime thermal management. Our extensive testing on systems with 16, 36, and 64 2.5D integrated chiplets and 16x3 3D integrated chiplets demonstrates that these models can reduce execution times from days to mere seconds and milliseconds with negligible loss in accuracy.

However, designing hardware accelerators for executing transformer models is challenging due to the wide variety of computing kernels involved in the transformer architecture. Existing accelerators are either inadequate to accelerate end-to-end transformer models or suffer notable thermal limitations. In this paper, we propose the design of a three-dimensional heterogeneous architecture referred to as HeTraX specifically optimized to accelerate end-to-end transformer models. HeTraX employs hardware resources aligned with the computational kernels of transformers and optimizes both performance and energy. Experimental results show that HeTraX outperforms existing state-of-the-art by up to 5.6x in speedup and improves EDP by 14.5x while ensuring thermally feasibility.

The proposed framework employs a loss function inspired by the finite element method (FEM) with the implicit Euler time integration scheme. A transient thermal conduction problem is considered to benchmark the performance. The proposed operator learning framework takes a temperature field at the current time step as input and predicts a temperature field at the next time step. The Galerkin discretized weak formulation of the heat equation is employed to incorporate physics into the loss function, which is coined finite operator learning (FOL). Upon training, the networks successfully predict the temperature evolution over time for any initial temperature field at high accuracy compared to the FEM solution. The framework is also confirmed to be applicable to a heterogeneous thermal conductivity and arbitrary geometry. The advantages of FOL can be summarized as follows: First, the training is performed in an unsupervised manner, avoiding the need for a large data set prepared from costly simulations or experiments. Instead, random temperature patterns generated by the Gaussian random process and the Fourier series, combined with constant temperature fields, are used as training data to cover possible temperature cases. Second, shape functions and backward difference approximation are exploited for the domain discretization, resulting in a purely algebraic equation. This enhances training efficiency, as one avoids time-consuming automatic differentiation when optimizing weights and biases while accepting possible discretization errors. Finally, thanks to the interpolation power of FEM, any arbitrary geometry can be handled with FOL, which is crucial to addressing various engineering application scenarios.

Inspired by the likelihood ratio idea, we construct a confidence set of the black-box function using only the preference feedback. An optimistic algorithm with an efficient computational method is then developed to solve the problem, which enjoys an information-theoretic bound on the total cumulative regret, a first-of-its-kind for preferential BO. This bound further allows us to design a scheme to report an estimated best solution, with a guaranteed convergence rate. Experimental results on sampled instances from Gaussian processes, standard test functions, and a thermal comfort optimization problem all show that our method stably achieves better or competitive performance as compared to the existing state-of-the-art heuristics, which, however, do not have theoretical guarantees on regret bounds or convergence.

The aggregate model that can describe the thermal dynamics of the building cluster is an important interference for energy systems to exploit its intrinsic thermal inertia. However, the private information of users, such as the indoor temperature and heating/cooling power, needs to be collected in the parameter estimation procedure to obtain the aggregate model, causing severe privacy concerns. In light of this, we propose a novel privacy-preserved parameter estimation approach to infer the aggregate model for the thermal dynamics of the building cluster for the first time. Using it, the parameters of the aggregate thermal dynamic model (ATDM) can be obtained by the load aggregator without accessing the individual's privacy information. More specifically, this method not only exploits the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to resolve its non-convexity in the estimation but investigates the transformation-based encryption (TE) associated with its secure aggregation protocol (SAP) techniques to realize privacy-preserved computation. Its capability of preserving privacy is also theoretically proven. Finally, simulation results using real-world data demonstrate the accuracy and privacy-preserved performance of our proposed method.

In contrast to recent works, we analyze a more general setting in which thermal noise is present that affects each student's generalization performance. In the nonzero temperature regime, we find that the coupling of replicas leads to a bend of the phase diagram towards smaller values of $Î±$: This suggests that the free entropy landscape gets smoother around the solution with perfect generalization (i.e., the teacher) at a fixed fraction of examples, allowing standard thermal updating algorithms such as Simulated Annealing to easily reach the teacher solution and avoid getting trapped in metastable states as it happens in the unreplicated case, even in the computationally \textit{easy} regime of the inference phase diagram. These results provide additional analytic and numerical evidence for the recently conjectured Bayes-optimal property of Replicated Simulated Annealing (RSA) for a sufficient number of replicas. From a learning perspective, these results also suggest that multiple students working together (in this case reviewing the same data) are able to learn the same rule both significantly faster and with fewer examples, a property that could be exploited in the context of cooperative and federated learning.

To construct the surrogate, we use the deep operator network (DeepONet) framework, a novel class of neural networks designed to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces using relatively small datasets. The proposed DeepONet takes an arbitrary continuous rib geometry with control points as input and outputs continuous detailed information about the distribution of pressure and heat transfer around the profiled ribs. The datasets needed to train and test the proposed DeepONet framework were obtained by simulating a 2D rib-roughened internal cooling channel. To accomplish this, we continuously modified the input rib geometry by adjusting the control points according to a simple random distribution with constraints, rather than following a predefined path or sampling method. The studied channel has a hydraulic diameter, Dh, of 66.7 mm, and a length-to-hydraulic diameter ratio, L/Dh, of 10. The ratio of rib center height to hydraulic diameter (e/Dh), which was not changed during the rib profile update, was maintained at a constant value of 0.048. The ribs were placed in the channel with a pitch-to-height ratio (P/e) of 10. In addition, we provide the proposed surrogates with effective uncertainty quantification capabilities. This is achieved by converting the DeepONet framework into a Bayesian DeepONet (B-DeepONet). B-DeepONet samples from the posterior distribution of DeepONet parameters using the novel framework of stochastic gradient replica-exchange MCMC.

We further introduce an asymmetric data augmentation technique M-CutOut, and enable semi-supervised learning to fully utilize RGB-T labels only sparsely available in practical use. Extensive experiments on MFNet and PST900 datasets demonstrate that SpiderMesh achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard RGB-T segmentation benchmarks.

Field trials in desert aviaries demonstrated reliable real time operation at 15 to 22 FPS with latency under 100 ms and confirmed that the platform elicits natural recognition and interactive responses from live Houbara bustards under harsh outdoor conditions. This integrated framework advances biomimetic field robotics by uniting reproducible digital fabrication, embodied visual intelligence, and ecological validation, providing a transferable blueprint for animal robot interaction research, conservation robotics, and public engagement.

However, these architectures are susceptible to thermal vulnerabilities due to the inherent vertical adjacency that occurs during the manufacturing process of HBM architectures. We anticipate that adversaries may exploit the intense vertical and lateral adjacency to design and develop thermal performance degradation attacks on the memory banks that host data/instructions from victim applications. In such attacks, the adversary manages to inject short and intense heat pulses from vertically and/or laterally adjacent memory banks, creating a convergent thermal wave that maximizes impact and delays the victim application from accessing its data/instructions. As the attacking application does not access any out-of-range memory locations, it can bypass both design-time security tests and the operating system's memory management policies. In other words, since the attack mimics legitimate workloads, it will be challenging to detect.

Despite their promise, current controlled superconducting components face fundamental challenges in cascadability, limiting their effectiveness in complex logic architectures. To overcome this, recent efforts have focused on developing gate tunable superconducting devices, such as Josephson junction field effect transistors (JJFETs). However, achieving robust control and sufficient supercurrent gain, both critical for transistor-like performance in logic circuits remains a key challenge. A recent advancement in JJFET design, based on InAs and GaSb heterostructures, demonstrates enhanced gain and favorable device characteristics suitable for circuit integration. Building on this innovation, we propose and analyze fundamental voltage controlled logic topologies using the quantum enhanced JJFET. We develop a Verilog A based circuit compatible compact model of the quantum enhanced JJFET which accurately captures the experimentally observed device characteristics. To ensure cascadability, our logic circuits incorporate the multilayered Heater Nanocryotron (nTron), a superconducting nanowire-based thermal switch. Through simulation based analysis, we demonstrate the successful implementation of fundamental logic gates, including NOT, NAND, and NOR. Furthermore, we design a 3 input majority gate, which plays a pivotal role in quantum and reversible computing due to its universality. Finally, to demonstrate the cascadability of our proposed logic topology, we demonstrate the operation of a 2 input XOR gate based on our designed JJFET based NOT, NAND, and NOR gate.

This paper introduces a probabilistic-learning-based stochastic surrogate modeling framework to address this challenge and significantly reduce the time required during the design phase. The approach begins with a neural network classifier that evaluates the feasibility of parameter configurations, effectively filtering out unsafe and/or impractical inputs. Subsequently, a probabilistic prediction model estimates the converter's efficiency and temperature while quantifying prediction uncertainty, providing both performance insights and reliability metrics. Finally, a heuristic optimization-based model is employed to optimize a multi-objective function that maximizes efficiency while adhering to thermal constraints. The optimization process incorporates penalty terms to discourage solutions that violate practical thresholds, ensuring actionable and realistic recommendations. An advanced heuristic optimization method is used to find the optimal solution and is compared with several well-known search algorithms, including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu-Search (TS), and Stochastic Hill Climbing (SHC). The results demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy and optimization outcomes, offering a robust solution for advancing power electronics design.

Cold exposure not only reduces subjective comfort but can impair cognitive performance, particularly under moderate to severe cold stress. Personal Comfort Systems (PCS) have shown promise by providing localized heating, yet many designs target distal body parts with low thermosensitivity and often lack portability. In this work, we investigate whether targeted thermal stimulation using in-ear worn devices can manipulate thermal perception and enhance thermal comfort. We present Heatables, a novel in-ear wearable that emits Near-Infrared (NIR) and Infrared (IR) radiation via integrated LEDs to deliver localized optical heating. This approach leverages NIR-IR's ability to penetrate deeper tissues, offering advantages over traditional resistive heating limited to surface warming. In a placebo-controlled study with 24 participants, each exposed for 150 minutes in a cool office environment (approximately 17.5 degrees Celsius) to simulate sustained cold stress during typical sedentary office activities, Heatables significantly increased the perceived ambient temperature by around 1.5 degrees Celsius and delayed cold discomfort. Importantly, thermal benefits extended beyond the ear region, improving both whole-body comfort and thermal acceptability. These findings position in-ear NIR-IR-LED-based stimulation as a promising modality for unobtrusive thermal comfort enhancement in everyday contexts.

One of the state-of-the-art approaches, Alternative Blind Power Identification (ABPI), theoretically eliminates the dependence on steady-state temperatures, addressing a major shortcoming of previous approaches. However, ABPI performance has remained unverified in actual hardware implementations. In this study, we conduct the first empirical validation of ABPI on commercial hardware using the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX platform. Our findings reveal that, while ABPI provides computational efficiency and independence from steady-state temperature, it exhibits considerable accuracy deficiencies in real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that integrates Custom Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CPINNs) with the underlying thermal model of ABPI. Our approach employs a specialized loss function that harmonizes physical principles with data-driven learning, complemented by multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization to balance estimation accuracy and computational cost. In experimental validation, CPINN-ABPI achieves a reduction of 84.7\% CPU and 73.9\% GPU in the mean absolute error (MAE) relative to ABPI, with the weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) improving from 47\%--81\% to $\sim$12\%. The method maintains real-time performance with 195.3~$Î¼$s of inference time, with similar 85\%--99\% accuracy gains across heterogeneous SoCs.

We propose scalar chaining, a novel hardware-software solution, to address this issue without incurring the drawbacks of traditional software-only techniques. We demonstrate our solution on register-limited stencil codes, achieving >93% FPU utilizations and a 4% speedup and 10% higher energy efficiency, on average, over highly-optimized baselines.

However, plenty of studies focus on designing complex modules to fuse different modalities. With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), valuable information can be more effectively extracted from natural language. Therefore, we aim to leverage the advantages of large language models to design a structurally simple and highly adaptable multimodal fusion model architecture. We proposed MultimodAl Segmentation with TExt PRompts (MASTER) architecture, which integrates LLM into the fusion of RGB-Thermal multimodal data and allows complex query text to participate in the fusion process. Our model utilizes a dual-path structure to extract information from different modalities of images. Additionally, we employ LLM as the core module for multimodal fusion, enabling the model to generate learnable codebook tokens from RGB, thermal images, and textual information. A lightweight image decoder is used to obtain semantic segmentation results. The proposed MASTER performs exceptionally well in benchmark tests across various automated driving scenarios, yielding promising results.

BPI (Blind Power Identification) is a recent approach that determines the power consumption of different cores and the thermal model of the chip using only thermal sensor measurements and total power consumption. BPI relies on steady-state thermal data along with a naive initialization in its Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) process, which negatively impacts the power estimation accuracy of BPI. This paper proposes a two-fold approach to reduce these impacts on BPI. First, this paper introduces an innovative approach for NMF initializing, i.e., density-oriented spatial clustering to identify centroid data points of active cores as initial values. This enhances BPI accuracy by focusing on dense regions in the dataset and excluding outlier data points. Second, it proposes the utilization of steady-state temperature data points to enhance the power estimation accuracy by leveraging the physical relationship between temperature and power consumption. Our extensive simulations of real-world cases demonstrate that our approach enhances BPI accuracy in estimating the power per core with no performance cost. For instance, in a four-core processor, the proposed approach reduces the error rate by 76% compared to BPI and by 24% compared to the state of the art in the literature, namely, Blind Power Identification Steady State (BPISS). The results underline the potential of integrating advanced clustering techniques in thermal model identification, paving the way for more accurate and reliable thermal management in multicores and SoCs.

However, these aggregate measurements are often insufficient for fine-grained thermal and power management. This paper presents an enhanced Clustering Blind Power Identification (ICBPI) approach, designed to improve the sensitivity and robustness of the traditional Blind Power Identification (BPI) method. BPI estimates the power consumption of individual cores and models the thermal behavior of an SoC using only thermal sensor data and total power measurements. The proposed ICBPI approach refines BPI's initialization process, particularly improving the non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) step, which is critical to the accuracy of BPI. ICBPI introduces density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) to better align temperature and power consumption data, thereby providing more accurate power consumption estimates. We validate the ICBPI method through two key tasks. The first task evaluates power estimation accuracy across four different multicore architectures, including a heterogeneous processor. Results show that ICBPI significantly enhances accuracy, reducing error rates by 77.56% compared to the original BPI and by 68.44% compared to the state-of-the-art BPISS method. The second task focuses on improving the detection and localization of malicious thermal sensor attacks in heterogeneous processors. The results demonstrate that ICBPI enhances the security and robustness of multicore SoCs against such attacks.

Here, we specifically focus on using a demand response (DR) algorithm to limit the energy consumption of a residential building's heating system while respecting user's thermal comfort. In that domain, Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been shown to be quite effective. One such RL method is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which has achieved impressive success in playing board games (go, chess). A particular advantage of MCTS is that its decision tree structure naturally allows to integrate exogenous constraints (e.g., by trimming branches that violate them), while conventional RL solutions need more elaborate techniques (e.g., indirectly by adding penalties in the cost/reward function, or through a backup controller that corrects constraint-violating actions). The main aim of this paper is to study the adoption of MCTS for building control, since this (to the best of our knowledge) has remained largely unexplored. A specific property of MCTS is that it needs a simulator component that can predict subsequent system states, based on actions taken. A straightforward data-driven solution is to use black-box neural networks (NNs). We will however extend a Physics-informed Neural Network (PiNN) model to deliver multi-timestep predictions, and show the benefit it offers in terms of lower prediction errors ($-$32\% MAE) as well as better MCTS performance ($-$4\% energy cost, $+$7\% thermal comfort) compared to a black-box NN. A second contribution will be to extend a vanilla MCTS version to adopt the ideas applied in AlphaZero (i.e., using learned prior and value functions and an action selection heuristic) to obtain lower computational costs while maintaining control performance.

Our previous work, the Visual Saliency Transformer (VST), addressed this constraint from a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence perspective, to unify RGB and RGB-D SOD. In VST, we developed a multi-task transformer decoder that concurrently predicts saliency and boundary outcomes in a pure transformer architecture. Moreover, we introduced a novel token upsampling method called reverse T2T for predicting a high-resolution saliency map effortlessly within transformer-based structures. Building upon the VST model, we further propose an efficient and stronger VST version in this work, i.e. VST++. To mitigate the computational costs of the VST model, we propose a Select-Integrate Attention (SIA) module, partitioning foreground into fine-grained segments and aggregating background information into a single coarse-grained token. To incorporate 3D depth information with low cost, we design a novel depth position encoding method tailored for depth maps. Furthermore, we introduce a token-supervised prediction loss to provide straightforward guidance for the task-related tokens. We evaluate our VST++ model across various transformer-based backbones on RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods while achieving a 25% reduction in computational costs without significant performance compromise. The demonstrated strong ability for generalization, enhanced performance, and heightened efficiency of our VST++ model highlight its potential.

While global mitigation action is undoubtedly necessary, so is climate adaptation, e.g., through climate-sensitive urban planning. Among the most promising strategies is harnessing the benefits of urban trees in shading and cooling pedestrian-level environments. Our work investigates the challenge of optimal placement of such trees. Physical simulations can estimate the radiative and thermal impact of trees on human thermal comfort but induce high computational costs. This rules out optimization of tree placements over large areas and considering effects over longer time scales. Hence, we employ neural networks to simulate the point-wise mean radiant temperatures--a driving factor of outdoor human thermal comfort--across various time scales, spanning from daily variations to extended time scales of heatwave events and even decades. To optimize tree placements, we harness the innate local effect of trees within the iterated local search framework with tailored adaptations. We show the efficacy of our approach across a wide spectrum of study areas and time scales. We believe that our approach is a step towards empowering decision-makers, urban designers and planners to proactively and effectively assess the potential of urban trees to mitigate heat stress.

Driving impairment can be monitored through active use of sensors (when drivers are asked to engage in providing breath samples to a vehicle instrument or when pulled over by a police officer), but a more passive and robust mechanism of sensing may allow for wider adoption and benefit of intelligent systems that reduce drunk driving accidents. This could assist in identifying impaired drivers before they drive, or early in the driving process (before a crash or detection by law enforcement). In this research, we introduce a study which adopts a multi-modal ensemble of visual, thermal, audio, and chemical sensors to (1) examine the impact of acute alcohol administration on driving performance in a driving simulator, and (2) identify data-driven methods for detecting driving under the influence of alcohol. We describe computer vision and machine learning models for analyzing the driver's face in thermal imagery, and introduce a pipeline for training models on data collected from drivers with a range of breath-alcohol content levels, including discussion of relevant machine learning phenomena which can help in future experiment design for related studies.

However, the domain gap and limited availability of large-scale datasets in the target domain make training robust and invariant HFR models from scratch difficult. In this work, we treat different modalities as distinct styles and propose a framework to adapt feature maps, bridging the domain gap. We introduce a novel Conditional Adaptive Instance Modulation (CAIM) module that can be integrated into pre-trained FR networks, transforming them into HFR networks. The CAIM block modulates intermediate feature maps, to adapt the style of the target modality effectively bridging the domain gap. Our proposed method allows for end-to-end training with a minimal number of paired samples. We extensively evaluate our approach on multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code and protocols for reproducing the findings will be made publicly available.

However, it is essentially hampered by two critical problems: 1) the day-night gap of RGB images is larger than that of thermal images, and 2) the class-wise performance of RGB images at night is not consistently higher or lower than that of thermal images. we propose the first test-time adaptation (TTA) framework, dubbed Night-TTA, to address the problems for nighttime RGBT semantic segmentation without access to the source (daytime) data during adaptation. Our method enjoys three key technical parts. Firstly, as one modality (e.g., RGB) suffers from a larger domain gap than that of the other (e.g., thermal), Imaging Heterogeneity Refinement (IHR) employs an interaction branch on the basis of RGB and thermal branches to prevent cross-modal discrepancy and performance degradation. Then, Class Aware Refinement (CAR) is introduced to obtain reliable ensemble logits based on pixel-level distribution aggregation of the three branches. In addition, we also design a specific learning scheme for our TTA framework, which enables the ensemble logits and three student logits to collaboratively learn to improve the quality of predictions during the testing phase of our Night TTA. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance with a 13.07% boost in mIoU.

In this paper, we present a multisensor fusion-based digital twin for in-situ quality monitoring and defect correction in a robotic laser direct energy deposition process. Multisensor fusion sources consist of an acoustic sensor, an infrared thermal camera, a coaxial vision camera, and a laser line scanner. The key novelty and contribution of this work are to develop a spatiotemporal data fusion method that synchronizes and registers the multisensor features within the part's 3D volume. The fused dataset can be used to predict location-specific quality using machine learning. On-the-fly identification of regions requiring material addition or removal is feasible. Robot toolpath and auto-tuned process parameters are generated for defecting correction. In contrast to traditional single-sensor-based monitoring, multisensor fusion allows for a more in-depth understanding of underlying process physics, such as pore formation and laser-material interactions. The proposed methods pave the way for self-adaptation AM with higher efficiency, less waste, and cleaner production.

However, indoor scenarios are rather static in terms of thermal state changes and, thus, cannot be applied to dynamic conditions, e.g., inside a vehicle. In this work, we present our findings of a gap between building and in-vehicle scenarios regarding thermal comfort estimation. We provide evidence by comparing deep neural classifiers for thermal comfort estimation for indoor and in-vehicle conditions. Further, we introduce a temporal dataset for indoor predictions incorporating 31 input signals and self-labeled user ratings by 18 subjects in a self-built climatic chamber. For in-vehicle scenarios, we acquired a second dataset featuring human judgments from 20 subjects in a BMW 3 Series. Our experimental results indicate superior performance for estimations from time series data over single vector input. Leveraging modern machine learning architectures enables us to recognize human thermal comfort states and estimate future states automatically. We provide details on training a recurrent network-based classifier and perform an initial performance benchmark of the proposed dataset. Ultimately, we compare our collected dataset to publicly available thermal comfort datasets.

To account for the presence of uncertainty in the optimal control problem, the objective function is composed with a risk measure. We focus on two risk measures, both involving high-dimensional integrals over the stochastic variables: the expected value and the (nonlinear) entropic risk measure. The high-dimensional integrals are computed numerically using specially designed QMC methods and, under moderate assumptions on the input random field, the error rate is shown to be essentially linear, independently of the stochastic dimension of the problem -- and thereby superior to ordinary Monte Carlo methods. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

To cope with the noisy labels problem, a class of methods focus on only easy samples with reliable labels but ignore valuable knowledge in hard samples. In this paper, we propose a novel USOD method to mine rich and accurate saliency knowledge from both easy and hard samples. First, we propose a Confidence-aware Saliency Distilling (CSD) strategy that scores samples conditioned on samples' confidences, which guides the model to distill saliency knowledge from easy samples to hard samples progressively. Second, we propose a Boundary-aware Texture Matching (BTM) strategy to refine the boundaries of noisy labels by matching the textures around the predicted boundary. Extensive experiments on RGB, RGB-D, RGB-T, and video SOD benchmarks prove that our method achieves state-of-the-art USOD performance.

However, RAQRs introduce a unique non-linear signal model based on biased phase retrieval, which complicates fundamental channel estimation tasks. Traditional iterative algorithms often struggle in low signal-to-noise regimes and fail to capture complex and non-ideal system characteristics. To address this, we propose a novel model-driven deep learning framework for channel estimation in RAQRs. Specifically, we propose a Transformer-based unrolling architecture, termed URformer, which is derived by unrolling a stabilized variant of the expectation-maximization Gerchberg-Saxton (EM-GS) algorithm. Specifically, each layer of the proposed URformer incorporates three trainable modules: 1) a learnable filter implemented by a neural network that replaces the fixed Bessel function ratio in the classic EM-GS algorithm; 2) a trainable gating mechanism that adaptively combines classic and model-based updates to ensure training stability; and 3) a efficient channel Transformer block that learns to correct residual errors by capturing non-local dependencies across the channel matrix. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed URformer significantly outperforms classic iterative algorithms and conventional black-box neural networks with less pilot overhead.

In this study, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework for forecasting the final extent of burned areas, using data available at the time of ignition. We leverage a spatio-temporal dataset that covers the Mediterranean region from 2006 to 2022, incorporating remote sensing data, meteorological observations, vegetation maps, land cover classifications, anthropogenic factors, topography data, and thermal anomalies. To evaluate the influence of temporal context, we conduct an ablation study examining how the inclusion of pre- and post-ignition data affects model performance, benchmarking the temporal-aware DL models against a baseline trained exclusively on ignition-day inputs. Our results indicate that multi-day observational data substantially improve predictive accuracy. Particularly, the best-performing model, incorporating a temporal window of four days before to five days after ignition, improves both the F1 score and the Intersection over Union by almost 5% in comparison to the baseline on the test dataset. We publicly release our dataset and models to enhance research into data-driven approaches for wildfire modeling and response.

While enhancing performance through specialized surface properties, these components may encounter difficulties in meeting modified requirements due to standardization in the refurbishment process. This article proposes updating the established coating process for thermally spray coated components for steel manufacturing (TCCSM) by integrating real-time data analytics and predictive quality management. Two essential components--the data aggregator and the quality predictor--are designed through continuous process monitoring and the application of data-driven methodologies to meet the dynamic demands of the evolving steel landscape. The quality predictor is powered by the simple and effective multiple kernel learning strategy with the goal of realizing predictive quality. The data aggregator, designed with sensors, flow meters, and intelligent data processing for the thermal spray coating process, is proposed to facilitate real-time analytics. The performance of this combination was verified using small-scale tests that enabled not only the accurate prediction of coating quality based on the collected data but also proactive notification to the operator as soon as significant deviations are identified.

The evolution from Internet DC to AI DC has introduced new challenges in operating and managing data centers for improved business resilience and reduced total cost of ownership. As a result, new paradigms, beyond the traditional approaches based on best practices, must be in order for future data centers. In this research, we propose and develop a novel Physical AI (PhyAI) framework for advancing DC operations and management. Our system leverages the emerging capabilities of state-of-the-art industrial products and our in-house research and development. Specifically, it presents three core modules, namely: 1) an industry-grade in-house simulation engine to simulate DC operations in a highly accurate manner, 2) an AI engine built upon NVIDIA PhysicsNemo for the training and evaluation of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) models, and 3) a digital twin platform built upon NVIDIA Omniverse for our proposed 5-tier digital twin framework. This system presents a scalable and adaptable solution to digitalize, optimize, and automate future data center operations and management, by enabling real-time digital twins for future data centers. To illustrate its effectiveness, we present a compelling case study on building a surrogate model for predicting the thermal and airflow profiles of a large-scale DC in a real-time manner. Our results demonstrate its superior performance over traditional time-consuming Computational Fluid Dynamics/Heat Transfer (CFD/HT) simulation, with a median absolute temperature prediction error of 0.18 Â°C. This emerging approach would open doors to several potential research directions for advancing Physical AI in future DC operations.

Since most existing buildings will still be in use by 2050, retrofitting is crucial for emissions reduction. However, current building assessment methods rely mainly on qualitative thermal imaging, which limits data-driven decisions for energy savings. On the other hand, quantitative assessments using finite element analysis (FEA) offer precise insights but require manual CAD design, which is tedious and error-prone. Recent advances in 3D reconstruction, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, enable precise 3D modeling from sparse images but lack clearly defined volumes and the interfaces between them needed for FEA. We propose Thermoxels, a novel voxel-based method able to generate FEA-compatible models, including both geometry and temperature, from a sparse set of RGB and thermal images. Using pairs of RGB and thermal images as input, Thermoxels represents a scene's geometry as a set of voxels comprising color and temperature information. After optimization, a simple process is used to transform Thermoxels' models into tetrahedral meshes compatible with FEA. We demonstrate Thermoxels' capability to generate RGB+Thermal meshes of 3D scenes, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. To showcase the practical applications of Thermoxels' models, we conduct a simple heat conduction simulation using FEA, achieving convergence from an initial state defined by Thermoxels' thermal reconstruction. Additionally, we compare Thermoxels' image synthesis abilities with current state-of-the-art methods, showing competitive results, and discuss the limitations of existing metrics in assessing mesh quality.

This paper explores a model predictive control (MPC) approach for building climate control, aimed at minimizing the noise nuisance generated by HPs. By exploiting a piecewise linear approximation of HP noise patterns and assuming linear building thermal dynamics, the proposed design can be generalized to handle various HP acoustic patterns with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Additionally, two computationally efficient options for defining the noise cost function in the proposed MPC design are discussed. Numerical experiments on a high-fidelity building simulator are performed to demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the proposed design. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can effectively reduce the noise pollution caused by HPs with negligible energy cost increase.

However, their application to multi-person tracking (MPT) has been limited due to data scarcity and the inherent difficulty of distinguishing individuals. In this study, we propose a cooperative MPT system that utilizes co-located RGB and thermal cameras, where pseudo-annotations (bounding boxes and person IDs) are used to train both RGB and thermal trackers. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the thermal tracker performs robustly in both bright and dark environments. Moreover, the results suggest that a tracker-switching strategy -- guided by a binary brightness classifier -- is more effective for information integration than a tracker-fusion approach. As an application example, we present an image change pattern recognition (ICPR) method, the ``human-as-landmark,'' which combines two key properties: the thermal recognizability of humans in dark environments and the rich landmark characteristics -- appearance, geometry, and semantics -- of static objects (occluders). Whereas conventional SLAM focuses on mapping static landmarks in well-lit environments, the present study takes a first step toward a new Human-Only SLAM paradigm, ``Dynamic-Dark SLAM,'' which aims to map even dynamic landmarks in complete darkness. Additionally, this study demonstrates that knowledge transfer between thermal and depth modalities enables reliable person tracking using low-resolution 3D LiDAR data without RGB input, contributing an important advance toward cross-robot SLAM systems.

Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses on detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By addressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex environments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more accurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D reconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot navigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise recognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving and rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and visible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for extracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model, equipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation branches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and parameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model in extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused images are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate depth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to integrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images from multimodal inputs.

However, existing methods often neglect the frequency characteristics of complementary information, such as the abundant high-frequency details in visible images and the valuable low-frequency thermal information in infrared images, thus constraining detection performance. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel Frequency-Driven Feature Decomposition Network for IVOD, called FD2-Net, which effectively captures the unique frequency representations of complementary information across multimodal visual spaces. Specifically, we propose a feature decomposition encoder, wherein the high-frequency unit (HFU) utilizes discrete cosine transform to capture representative high-frequency features, while the low-frequency unit (LFU) employs dynamic receptive fields to model the multi-scale context of diverse objects. Next, we adopt a parameter-free complementary strengths strategy to enhance multimodal features through seamless inter-frequency recoupling. Furthermore, we innovatively design a multimodal reconstruction mechanism that recovers image details lost during feature extraction, further leveraging the complementary information from infrared and visible images to enhance overall representational capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FD2-Net outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across various IVOD benchmarks, i.e. LLVIP (96.2% mAP), FLIR (82.9% mAP), and M3FD (83.5% mAP).

However, traditional sensors often fail and degrade in harsh environments where physical sensors cannot be placed (inaccessible locations). In addition, there are important parameters that cannot be directly measured by sensors. We need machine learning (ML)-based real-time monitoring in those remote locations to ensure system operations. However, traditional ML models struggle to process continuous sensor profile data to fit model requirements, leading to the loss of spatial relationships. Another challenge for real-time monitoring is ``dataset shift" and the need for frequent retraining under varying conditions, where extensive retraining prohibits real-time inference. To resolve these challenges, this study addressed the limitations of real-time monitoring methods by enabling monitoring in locations where physical sensors are impractical to deploy. Our proposed approach, utilizing Multi-Input Operator Network virtual sensors, leverages deep learning to seamlessly integrate diverse data sources and accurately predict key parameters in real-time without the need for additional physical sensors. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through thermal-hydraulic monitoring in a nuclear reactor subchannel, achieving remarkable accuracy.

However, the demanding hardware requirements of high-resolution IR sensors limit its widespread application. As an alternative, visible light can be used to synthesize IR images but this causes a loss of fidelity in image details and introduces inconsistencies due to lack of contextual awareness of the scene. This stems from a combination of using visible light with a standard dynamic range, especially under extreme lighting, and a lack of contextual awareness can result in pseudo-thermal-crossover artifacts. This occurs when multiple objects with similar temperatures appear indistinguishable in the training data, further exacerbating the loss of fidelity. To solve this challenge, this paper proposes CapHDR2IR, a novel framework incorporating vision-language models using high dynamic range (HDR) images as inputs to generate IR images. HDR images capture a wider range of luminance variations, ensuring reliable IR image generation in different light conditions. Additionally, a dense caption branch integrates semantic understanding, resulting in more meaningful and discernible IR outputs. Extensive experiments on the HDRT dataset show that the proposed CapHDR2IR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing general domain transfer methods and those tailored for visible-to-infrared image translation.

We adopt an on-the-fly strategy to tackle these challenges, formulating the planner as a Deep Q-Network (DQN) based optimizer to decide the next `best' node to visit. We construct the state spaces by the Local Search Graph (LSG) centered at different nodes on a graph, which is encoded by a carefully designed algorithm so that LSGs in similar configurations can be identified to re-use the earlier learned DQN priors for accelerating the computation of toolpath planning. Our method can cover different 3D printing applications by defining their corresponding reward functions. Toolpath planning problems in wire-frame printing, continuous fiber printing, and metallic printing are selected to demonstrate its generality. The performance of our planner has been verified by testing the resultant toolpaths in physical experiments. By using our planner, wire-frame models with up to 4.2k struts can be successfully printed, up to 93.3% of sharp turns on continuous fiber toolpaths can be avoided, and the thermal distortion in metallic printing can be reduced by 24.9%.

This has inspired the recent development of Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundation model for general mask segmentation. However, SAM is largely tailored for single-modal RGB images, limiting its applicability to multi-modal data captured with widely-adopted sensor suites, such as LiDAR plus RGB, depth plus RGB, thermal plus RGB, etc. We develop MM-SAM, an extension and expansion of SAM that supports cross-modal and multi-modal processing for robust and enhanced segmentation with different sensor suites. MM-SAM features two key designs, namely, unsupervised cross-modal transfer and weakly-supervised multi-modal fusion, enabling label-efficient and parameter-efficient adaptation toward various sensor modalities. It addresses three main challenges: 1) adaptation toward diverse non-RGB sensors for single-modal processing, 2) synergistic processing of multi-modal data via sensor fusion, and 3) mask-free training for different downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that MM-SAM consistently outperforms SAM by large margins, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across various sensors and data modalities.

This determination impacts various factors, including the acceleration induced by solar radiation pressure, the spacecraft power input, and its thermal state all of which must be accounted for in various phases of the mission design. This study leverages recent advances in neural image processing to develop fully differentiable models of eclipse regions for highly irregular celestial bodies. By utilizing test cases involving Solar System bodies previously visited by spacecraft, such as 433 Eros, 25143 Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, and 101955 Bennu, we propose and study an implicit neural architecture defining the shape of the eclipse cone based on the Sun's direction. Employing periodic activation functions, we achieve high precision in modeling eclipse conditions. Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of these differentiable models in spaceflight mechanics computations.

Traditional high dynamic range (HDR) methods, like multi-exposure fusion or inverse tone mapping, struggle with ghosting and incomplete data reconstruction. Infrared (IR) imaging offers a unique advantage by being less affected by lighting conditions, providing consistent detail capture regardless of visible light intensity. In this paper, we introduce the HDRT dataset, the first comprehensive dataset that consists of HDR and thermal IR images. The HDRT dataset comprises 50,000 images captured across three seasons over six months in eight cities, providing a diverse range of lighting conditions and environmental contexts. Leveraging this dataset, we propose HDRTNet, a novel deep neural method that fuses IR and SDR content to generate HDR images. Extensive experiments validate HDRTNet against the state-of-the-art, showing substantial quantitative and qualitative quality improvements. The HDRT dataset not only advances IR-guided HDR imaging but also offers significant potential for broader research in HDR imaging, multi-modal fusion, domain transfer, and beyond. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jingchao-peng/HDRTDataset.

However, existing methods typically require dense scene measurements and often rely on RGB images for 3D geometry reconstruction, projecting thermal information post-reconstruction. This can lead to inconsistencies between the reconstructed geometry and temperature data and their actual values. To address this challenge, we propose ThermoNeRF, a novel multimodal approach based on Neural Radiance Fields that jointly renders new RGB and thermal views of a scene, and ThermoScenes, a dataset of paired RGB+thermal images comprising 8 scenes of building facades and 8 scenes of everyday objects. To address the lack of texture in thermal images, ThermoNeRF uses paired RGB and thermal images to learn scene density, while separate networks estimate color and temperature data. Unlike comparable studies, our focus is on temperature reconstruction and experimental results demonstrate that ThermoNeRF achieves an average mean absolute error of 1.13C and 0.41C for temperature estimation in buildings and other scenes, respectively, representing an improvement of over 50% compared to using concatenated RGB+thermal data as input to a standard NeRF. Code and dataset are available online.

However, relying solely on deep learning models to obtain better tracking results requires carefully selecting feature information that is beneficial to representing the target object and designing a reasonable template update strategy, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty of model design. Thus, recent TIR tracking methods face many challenges in complex scenarios. This paper introduces a novel Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) method to enhance TIR tracking in these challenging situations. DBF is distinctive in its dual-model structure: the system and observation models. The system model leverages motion data to estimate the potential positions of the target object based on two-dimensional Brownian motion, thus generating a prior probability. Following this, the observation model comes into play upon capturing the TIR image. It serves as a classifier and employs infrared information to ascertain the likelihood of these estimated positions, creating a likelihood probability. According to the guidance of the two models, the position of the target object can be determined, and the template can be dynamically updated. Experimental analysis across several benchmark datasets reveals that DBF achieves competitive performance, surpassing most existing TIR tracking methods in complex scenarios.

AlexNet and ResNet are widely used as backbone networks in TIR-PT applications. However, these architectures were originally designed for image classification and object detection tasks, which are less complex than the challenges presented by TIR-PT. This paper makes an early attempt to search an optimal network architecture for TIR-PT automatically, employing single-bottom and dual-bottom cells as basic search units and incorporating eight operation candidates within the search space. To expedite the search process, a random channel selection strategy is employed prior to assessing operation candidates. Classification, batch hard triplet, and center loss are jointly used to retrain the searched architecture. The outcome is a high-performance network architecture that is both parameter- and computation-efficient. Extensive experiments proved the effectiveness of the automated method.

However, these methods often struggle to achieve higher accuracy in densely crowded scenes with poor illumination. Recently, some studies have reported improvement in the accuracy of crowd counting models using a combination of RGB and thermal images. Although multimodal data can lead to better predictions, multimodal data might not be always available beforehand. In this paper, we propose the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to automatically generate thermal infrared (TIR) images from color (RGB) images and use both to train crowd counting models to achieve higher accuracy. We use a Pix2Pix GAN network first to translate RGB images to TIR images. Our experiments on several state-of-the-art crowd counting models and benchmark crowd datasets report significant improvement in accuracy.

Real-time, meticulous monitoring of system conditions is essential, especially in manufacturing high-quality and safety-critical components such as spray coatings. However, acquiring accurate health status information (HI labels) in real scenarios can be difficult or costly because it requires continuous, precise measurements that fully capture the system's health. As a result, using datasets from systems run-to-failure, which provide limited HI labels only at the healthy and end-of-life phases, becomes a practical approach. We employ Deep Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection (DeepSAD) embeddings to tackle the challenge of extracting features associated with the system's health state. Additionally, we introduce a diversity loss to further enrich the DeepSAD embeddings. We also propose applying an alternating projection algorithm with isotonic constraints to transform the embedding into a normalized HI with an increasing trend. Validation on the PHME2010 milling dataset, a recognized benchmark with ground truth HIs, confirms the efficacy of our proposed HI estimations. Our methodology is further applied to monitor the wear states of thermal spray coatings using high-frequency voltage. These contributions facilitate more accessible and reliable HI estimation, particularly in scenarios where obtaining ground truth HI labels is impossible.

For example, it was recently shown that certain linear algebra problems can be solved thermodynamically, leading to an asymptotic speedup scaling with the matrix dimension. The origin of this "thermodynamic advantage" has not yet been fully explained, and it is not clear what other problems might benefit from it. Here we provide a new thermodynamic algorithm for exponentiating a real matrix, with applications in simulating linear dynamical systems. We describe a simple electrical circuit involving coupled oscillators, whose thermal equilibration can implement our algorithm. We also show that this algorithm also provides an asymptotic speedup that is linear in the dimension. Finally, we introduce the concept of thermodynamic parallelism to explain this speedup, stating that thermodynamic noise provides a resource leading to effective parallelization of computations, and we hypothesize this as a mechanism to explain thermodynamic advantage more generally.

Experimental data obtained from thermal spray coating trials are used to validate the presented approach, demonstrating that it is able to accurately model and predict critical target variables. As such, the framework has significant potential for the optimization of thermal spray coating processes, and can contribute to the development of more efficient and effective coating technologies in various industries.

However, in harsh environments, the discriminative cues in RGB and NIR modalities are often lost due to strong flares from vehicle lamps or sunlight, and existing multi-modal fusion methods are limited in their ability to recover these important cues. To address this problem, we propose a Flare-Aware Cross-modal Enhancement Network that adaptively restores flare-corrupted RGB and NIR features with guidance from the flare-immunized thermal infrared spectrum. First, to reduce the influence of locally degraded appearance due to intense flare, we propose a Mutual Flare Mask Prediction module to jointly obtain flare-corrupted masks in RGB and NIR modalities in a self-supervised manner. Second, to use the flare-immunized TI information to enhance the masked RGB and NIR, we propose a Flare-Aware Cross-modal Enhancement module that adaptively guides feature extraction of masked RGB and NIR spectra with prior flare-immunized knowledge from the TI spectrum. Third, to extract common informative semantic information from RGB and NIR, we propose an Inter-modality Consistency loss that enforces semantic consistency between the two modalities. Finally, to evaluate the proposed FACENet in handling intense flare, we introduce a new multi-spectral vehicle re-ID dataset, called WMVEID863, with additional challenges such as motion blur, significant background changes, and particularly intense flare degradation. Comprehensive experiments on both the newly collected dataset and public benchmark multi-spectral vehicle re-ID datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FACENet compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in handling strong flares. The code and dataset will be released at this link.

The key points of RGBT tracking lie in feature extraction and feature fusion of visible and infrared images. Current RGBT tracking methods mostly pay attention to both individual features (features extracted from images of a single camera) and common features (features extracted and fused from an RGB camera and a thermal camera), while pay less attention to the different and dynamic contributions of individual features and common features for different sequences of registered image pairs. This paper proposes a novel RGBT tracking method, called Dynamic Fusion Network (DFNet), which adopts a two-stream structure, in which two non-shared convolution kernels are employed in each layer to extract individual features. Besides, DFNet has shared convolution kernels for each layer to extract common features. Non-shared convolution kernels and shared convolution kernels are adaptively weighted and summed according to different image pairs, so that DFNet can deal with different contributions for different sequences. DFNet has a fast speed, which is 28.658 FPS. The experimental results show that when DFNet only increases the Mult-Adds of 0.02% than the non-shared-convolution-kernel-based fusion method, Precision Rate (PR) and Success Rate (SR) reach 88.1% and 71.9% respectively.

They have the unique advantages of passive imaging, temperature sensitivity and penetration. But the security of these systems themselves has not been fully explored, which poses risks in applying these systems. We propose a physical attack method with small bulbs on a board against the state of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Our goal is to make infrared pedestrian detectors unable to detect real-world pedestrians. Towards this goal, we first showed that it is possible to use two kinds of patches to attack the infrared pedestrian detector based on YOLOv3. The average precision (AP) dropped by 64.12% in the digital world, while a blank board with the same size caused the AP to drop by 29.69% only. After that, we designed and manufactured a physical board and successfully attacked YOLOv3 in the real world. In recorded videos, the physical board caused AP of the target detector to drop by 34.48%, while a blank board with the same size caused the AP to drop by 14.91% only. With the ensemble attack techniques, the designed physical board had good transferability to unseen detectors. We also proposed the first physical multispectral (infrared and visible) attack. By using a combination method, we successfully hide from the visible light and infrared object detection systems at the same time.

For classical systems, we have a unified perspective which connects structural properties of systems at thermal equilibrium to the Markov chain dynamics that mix to them. We lack such a perspective for quantum systems: there is no framework to translate the quantitative convergence of the Markovian evolution into strong structural consequences. We develop a general framework that brings the breadth and flexibility of the classical theory to quantum Gibbs states at high temperature. At its core is a natural quantum analog of a Dobrushin condition; whenever this condition holds, a concise path-coupling argument proves rapid mixing for the corresponding Markovian evolution. The same machinery bridges dynamic and structural properties: rapid mixing yields exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI) without restrictions on the size of the probed subsystems, resolving a central question in the theory of open quantum systems. Our key technical insight is an optimal transport viewpoint which couples quantum dynamics to a linear differential equation, enabling precise control over how local deviations from equilibrium propagate to distant sites.

Unlike conventional 1T-1C dynamic RAM (DRAM), which incurs refresh overhead, 2T-nC FeRAM offers a promising alternative as a non-volatile memory solution with low energy consumption. Our key findings include the potential of quasi-nondestructive readout (QNRO) sensing in 2T-nC FeRAM for logic-in-memory (LiM) applications, demonstrating its inherent capability to perform inverting logic without requiring external modifications, a feature absent in traditional 1T-1C DRAM. We successfully implement the MINORITY function within a single cell of 2T-nC FeRAM, enabling universal NAND and NOR logic, validated through SPICE simulations and experimental data. Additionally, the research investigates the feasibility of 3D integration with 2T-nC FeRAM, showing substantial improvements in storage and computational density, facilitating bulk-bitwise computation. Our evaluation of eight real-world, data-intensive applications reveals that 2T-nC FeRAM achieves 2x higher performance and 2.5x lower energy consumption compared to DRAM. Furthermore, the thermal stability of stacked 2T-nC FeRAM is validated, confirming its reliable operation when integrated on a compute die. These findings emphasize the advantages of 2T-nC FeRAM for LiM, offering superior performance and energy efficiency over conventional DRAM.

In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.
  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.
  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

Anomaly detection in battery thermal images helps identify failures early, but traditional deep learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is difficult to obtain, especially for anomalies due to safety risks and high data collection costs. To overcome this, we explore zero-shot anomaly detection using Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, which leverage pretrained knowledge and textbased prompts to generalize across vision tasks. By incorporating prior knowledge of normal battery thermal behavior, we design prompts to detect anomalies without battery-specific training data. We evaluate three VQA models (ChatGPT-4o, LLaVa-13b, and BLIP-2) analyzing their robustness to prompt variations, repeated trials, and qualitative outputs. Despite the lack of finetuning on battery data, our approach demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models that are trained with the battery data.

Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data. Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.

However, existing large vision language model (LVLM) approaches are unable to understand low-resolution data well as they are primarily designed for high-resolution data, such as RGB images. A quick fixing approach is to caption a large amount of low-resolution data, but it requires a significant amount of labor-intensive annotation efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel, labor-saving system, Llambda, designed to support low-resolution HBU. The core idea is to leverage limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to guide LLMs in generating informative captions, which can be combined with raw data to effectively fine-tune LVLM models for understanding low-resolution videos in HBU. First, we propose a Contrastive-Oriented Data Labeler, which can capture behavior-relevant information from long, low-resolution videos and generate high-quality pseudo labels for unlabeled data via contrastive learning. Second, we propose a Physical-Knowledge Guided Captioner, which utilizes spatial and temporal consistency checks to mitigate errors in pseudo labels. Therefore, it can improve LLMs' understanding of sequential data and then generate high-quality video captions. Finally, to ensure on-device deployability, we employ LoRA-based efficient fine-tuning to adapt LVLMs for low-resolution data. We evaluate Llambda using a region-scale real-world testbed and three distinct low-resolution datasets, and the experiments show that Llambda outperforms several state-of-the-art LVLM systems up to $40.03\%$ on average Bert-Score.

While conventional physical design for 2.5D heterogeneous systems typically prioritizes wirelength reduction through tight chiplet packing, this strategy creates thermal bottlenecks and intensifies coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches, compromising long-term reliability. Addressing these challenges requires holistic consideration of thermal performance, mechanical stress, and interconnect efficiency. We introduce STAMP-2.5D, the first automated floorplanning methodology that simultaneously optimizes these critical factors. Our approach employs finite element analysis to simulate temperature distributions and stress profiles across chiplet configurations while minimizing interconnect wirelength. Experimental results demonstrate that our thermal structural aware automated floorplanning approach reduces overall stress by 11% while maintaining excellent thermal performance with a negligible 0.5% temperature increase and simultaneously reducing total wirelength by 11% compared to temperature-only optimization. Additionally, we conduct an exploratory study on the effects of temperature gradients on structural integrity, providing crucial insights for reliability-conscious chiplet design. STAMP-2.5D establishes a robust platform for navigating critical trade-offs in advanced semiconductor packaging.

Leveraging large quantum mechanical databases and expressive architectures, recent ''universal'' models deliver qualitative accuracy across the periodic table but are often biased toward low-energy configurations. We introduce PET-MAD, a generally applicable MLIP trained on a dataset combining stable inorganic and organic solids, systematically modified to enhance atomic diversity. Using a moderate but highly-consistent level of electronic-structure theory, we assess PET-MAD's accuracy on established benchmarks and advanced simulations of six materials. Despite the small training set and lightweight architecture, PET-MAD is competitive with state-of-the-art MLIPs for inorganic solids, while also being reliable for molecules, organic materials, and surfaces. It is stable and fast, enabling the near-quantitative study of thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations, functional properties, and phase transitions out of the box. It can be efficiently fine-tuned to deliver full quantum mechanical accuracy with a minimal number of targeted calculations.

This paper outlines the use of Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAI) implemented in the context of the built environment to provide information that helps humans minimize the impact of heat and noise on their daily lives. This framework is based on the open-source Cozie iOS smartwatch platform. It includes data collection through micro-surveys and intervention messages triggered by environmental, contextual, and personal history conditions. An eight-month deployment of the method was completed in Singapore with 103 participants who submitted more than 12,000 micro-surveys and had more than 3,600 JITAI intervention messages delivered to them. A weekly survey conducted during two deployment phases revealed an overall increase in perceived usefulness ranging from 8-19% over the first three weeks of data collection. For noise-related interventions, participants showed an overall increase in location changes ranging from 4-11% and a 2-17% increase in earphone use to mitigate noise distractions. For thermal comfort-related interventions, participants demonstrated a 3-13\% increase in adjustments to their location or thermostat to feel more comfortable. The analysis found evidence that personality traits (such as conscientiousness), gender, and environmental preferences could be factors in determining the perceived helpfulness of JITAIs and influencing behavior change. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring intervention strategies to individual traits and environmental conditions, setting the stage for future research to refine the delivery, timing, and content of intervention messages.

Smoothed particle hydrodynamics(SPH) is a fully Lagrangian method widely used for simulating multi-physics applications with high computational efficiency and accuracy.

The focus of this study is to simulate the heat transfer process in various window frames under convective boundary conditions according to ISO10077-2:2012. This paper demonstrates the accuracy and compatibility of SPH when dealing with heat transfer problems, which ensures further development of thermal coupling with other physical fields.

Traditional techniques often are inadequate for LLM inference due to the fine-grained, millisecond-scale execution phases, each with distinct performance, thermal, and power profiles. Additionally, LLM inference workloads are sensitive to various configuration parameters (e.g., model parallelism, size, and quantization) that involve trade-offs between performance, temperature, power, and output quality. Moreover, clouds often co-locate SaaS and IaaS workloads, each with different levels of visibility and flexibility. We propose TAPAS, a thermal- and power-aware framework designed for LLM inference clusters in the cloud. TAPAS enhances cooling and power oversubscription capabilities, reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) while effectively handling emergencies (e.g., cooling and power failures). The system leverages historical temperature and power data, along with the adaptability of SaaS workloads, to: (1) efficiently place new GPU workload VMs within cooling and power constraints, (2) route LLM inference requests across SaaS VMs, and (3) reconfigure SaaS VMs to manage load spikes and emergency situations. Our evaluation on a large GPU cluster demonstrates significant reductions in thermal and power throttling events, boosting system efficiency.

To overcome the non-convex limitations of karush-kuhn-tucker (KKT)-based methods, a novel optimization solution method based on DRL theory is proposed to handle the bi-level programming through alternate iterations between levels. Specifically, by combining a DRL algorithm named asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and automated machine learning-prioritized experience replay (AutoML-PER) strategy to improve the generalization performance of A3C to address the above problems, an improved A3C algorithm, called AutoML-PER-A3C, is designed to solve the upper-level problem; while the DOCPLEX optimizer is adopted to address the lower-level problem. In this solution process, AutoML is used to automatically optimize hyperparameters and PER improves learning efficiency and quality by extracting the most valuable samples. The test results demonstrate that the presented approach manages to reconcile the interests between multiple stakeholders in MG by fully exploiting various flexibility resources. Furthermore, in terms of economic viability and computational efficiency, the proposal vastly exceeds other advanced reinforcement learning methods.

These heterogeneous image modalities collected by different hardware devices are widely prevalent in practical applications, and the substantial differences between modalities pose significant challenges to attack transferability. In this work, we explore a novel cross-modal adversarial attack strategy, termed multiform attack. We propose a dual-layer optimization framework based on gradient-evolution, facilitating efficient perturbation transfer between modalities. In the first layer of optimization, the framework utilizes image gradients to learn universal perturbations within each modality and employs evolutionary algorithms to search for shared perturbations with transferability across different modalities through secondary optimization. Through extensive testing on multiple heterogeneous datasets, we demonstrate the superiority and robustness of Multiform Attack compared to existing techniques. This work not only enhances the transferability of cross-modal adversarial attacks but also provides a new perspective for understanding security vulnerabilities in cross-modal systems.

Thermal imaging cameras, which capture infrared radiation, are robust to visual degradation. However, due to lack of a large-scale dataset, the use of thermal cameras for unmanned aerial system (UAS) depth perception has remained largely unexplored. This paper presents a stereo thermal depth perception dataset for autonomous aerial perception applications. The dataset consists of stereo thermal images, LiDAR, IMU and ground truth depth maps captured in urban and forest settings under diverse conditions like day, night, rain, and smoke. We benchmark representative stereo depth estimation algorithms, offering insights into their performance in degraded conditions. Models trained on our dataset generalize well to unseen smoky conditions, highlighting the robustness of stereo thermal imaging for depth perception. We aim for this work to enhance robotic perception in disaster scenarios, allowing for exploration and operations in previously unreachable areas.

This physics-informed machine learning method enables us to infer continuous temperature fields using only sparse velocity data, hence eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. Specifically, AIVT is based on physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (not neural networks) and is trained by optimizing a combined loss function that minimizes the residuals of the velocity data, boundary conditions, and the governing equations. We apply AIVT to a unique set of experimental volumetric and simultaneous temperature and velocity data of Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection (RBC) that we acquired by combining Particle Image Thermometry and Lagrangian Particle Tracking. This allows us to compare AIVT predictions and measurements directly. We demonstrate that we can reconstruct and infer continuous and instantaneous velocity and temperature fields from sparse experimental data at a fidelity comparable to direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulence. This, in turn, enables us to compute important quantities for quantifying turbulence, such as fluctuations, viscous and thermal dissipation, and QR distribution. This paradigm shift in processing experimental data using AIVT to infer turbulent fields at DNS-level fidelity is a promising avenue in breaking the current deadlock of quantitative understanding of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, where DNS is computationally infeasible.

By using nonlinearities within a silicon MRR, such as the ones caused by free-carrier dispersion (FCD) and thermo-optic (TO) effects, it is possible to map the input data of the RC to a higher dimensional space. Furthermore, by adding an external waveguide between the through and add ports of the MRR, it is possible to implement a time-delay RC (TDRC) with enhanced memory. The input from the through port is fed back into the add port of the ring with the delay applied by the external waveguide effectively adding memory. In a TDRC, the nodes are multiplexed in time, and their respective time evolutions are detected at the drop port. The performance of MRR-based TDRC is highly dependent on the amount of nonlinearity in the MRR. The nonlinear effects, in turn, are dependent on the physical properties of the MRR as they determine the lifetime of the effects. Another factor to take into account is the stability of the MRR response, as strong time-domain discontinuities at the drop port are known to emerge from FCD nonlinearities due to self-pulsing (high nonlinear behaviour). However, quantifying the right amount of nonlinearity that RC needs for a certain task in order to achieve optimum performance is challenging. Therefore, further analysis is required to fully understand the nonlinear dynamics of this TDRC setup. Here, we quantify the nonlinear and linear memory capacity of the previously described microring-based TDRC scheme, as a function of the time constants of the generated carriers and the thermal of the TO effects. We analyze the properties of the TDRC dynamics that generate the parameter space, in terms of input signal power and frequency detuning range, over which conventional RC tasks can be satisfactorily performed by the TDRC scheme.

We analyse the space-time complexity of Boolean circuits derived from the electrical responses of colloids: ZnO (zinc oxide, an inorganic compound also known as calamine or zinc white, which naturally occurs as the mineral zincite), proteinoids (microspheres and crystals of thermal abiotic proteins), and combinations thereof to electrical stimulation. To extract Boolean circuits from colloids, we send all possible configurations of two-, four-, and eight-bit binary strings, encoded as electrical potential values, to the colloids, record their responses, and thereby infer the Boolean functions they implement. We map the discovered functions onto the cell-state transition rules of cellular automata (arrays of binary state machines that update their states synchronously according to the same rule) -- the colloid cellular automata. We then analyse the phenomenology of the space-time configurations of the automata and evaluate their complexity using measures such as compressibility, Shannon entropy, Simpson diversity, and expressivity. A hierarchy of phenomenological and measurable space-time complexity is constructed.

Specifically, for a local Hamiltonian $H$ on a graph with degree $\mathfrak{d}$, its Gibbs state at inverse temperature $Î²$, denoted by $Ï= e^{-Î²H}/ \operatorname{tr}(e^{-Î²H})$, is a classical distribution over product states for all $Î²< 1/(c\mathfrak{d})$, where $c$ is a constant. This proof of sudden death of thermal entanglement resolves the fundamental question of whether many-body systems can exhibit entanglement at high temperature.
  Moreover, we show that we can efficiently sample from the distribution over product states. In particular, for any $Î²< 1/( c \mathfrak{d}^2)$, we can prepare a state $\varepsilon$-close to $Ï$ in trace distance with a depth-one quantum circuit and $\operatorname{poly}(n, 1/\varepsilon)$ classical overhead.

However, passive RIS (PRIS) still suffers from some pressing issues, one of which is that the fading of the entire reflection link is proportional to the product of the distances from the base station to the PRIS and from the PRIS to the users, i.e., the productive attenuation. To tackle this problem, active RIS (ARIS) has been proposed to reconfigure the wireless propagation condition and alleviate the productive attenuation. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security of the ARIS assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks with the attendance of external and internal eavesdroppers. To be specific, the closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secrecy system throughput are derived by invoking both imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC) and perfect SIC. The secrecy diversity orders of legitimate users are obtained at high signal-to-noise ratios. Numerical results are presented to verify the accuracy of the theoretical expressions and indicate that: i) The SOP of ARIS assisted NOMA networks exceeds that of PRIS-NOMA, ARIS/PRIS-assisted orthogonal multiple access (OMA); ii) Due to the balance between the thermal noise and residual interference, introducing excess reconfigurable elements at ARIS is not helpful to reduce the SOP; and iii) The secrecy throughput performance of ARIS-NOMA networks outperforms that of PRIS-NOMA and ARIS/PRIS-OMA networks.

When compared to existing traditional methods, an optimization-based method with ODE models and reinforcement learning, our approach can significantly reduce the energy consumption while guarantees all the safety-critical air quality and control constraints. Promising future research directions involve validating and improving the proposed PDE models through accurate estimation of airflow fields within indoor environments.

The microstructure composition plays an important role in characterizing the part quality and deriving mechanical properties. When complete parts are simulated, one often needs to resort to strong simplifications such as layer-wise heating due to the large number of simulated time steps compared to the small time step sizes. This article proposes a scan-resolved approach to the coupled thermo-microstructural problem. Building on a highly efficient thermal model, we discuss the implementation of a phenomenological microstructure model for the evolution of the three main constituents of Ti-6Al-4V: stable $Î±_s$-phase, martensite $Î±_m$-phase and $Î²$-phase. The implementation is tailored to modern hardware features using vectorization and fast approximations of transcendental functions. A performance model and numerical examples verify the high degree of optimization. We demonstrate the applicability and predictive power of the approach and the influence of scan strategy and geometry. Depending on the specific example, results can be obtained with moderate computational resources in a few hours to days. The numerical examples include a prediction of the microstructure on the full NIST AM Benchmark cantilever specimen.

These processes are accompanied by rapid evaporation so that the evaporation-induced recoil pressure and cooling arise as major driving forces for fluid dynamics and temperature evolution. The magnitude of these interface fluxes depends exponentially on the melt pool surface temperature, which, therefore, has to be predicted with high accuracy. The present work utilizes a diffuse interface finite element model based on a continuum surface flux (CSF) description of interface fluxes to study dimensionally reduced thermal two-phase problems representative for PBF-LB/M in a finite element framework. It is demonstrated that the extreme temperature gradients combined with the high ratios of material properties between metal and ambient gas lead to significant errors in the interface temperatures and fluxes when classical CSF approaches, along with typical interface thicknesses and discretizations, are applied. It is expected that this finding is also relevant for other types of diffuse interface PBF-LB/M melt pool models. A novel parameter-scaled CSF approach is proposed, which is constructed to yield a smoother temperature field in the diffuse interface region, significantly increasing the solution accuracy. The interface thickness required to predict the temperature field with a given level of accuracy is less restrictive by at least one order of magnitude for the proposed parameter-scaled approach compared to classical CSF, drastically reducing computational costs. Finally, we showcase the general applicability of the parameter-scaled CSF to a 3D simulation of stationary laser melting of PBF-LB/M considering the fully coupled thermo-hydrodynamic multi-phase problem, including phase change.

The model addresses challenges including discontinuities in the density field by several orders of magnitude, leading to high velocity and pressure jumps across the liquid-vapor interface, along with dynamically changing interface topologies. To this end, we integrate an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver combined with a conservative level-set formulation and a regularized, i.e., diffuse, representation of discontinuities into a matrix-free adaptive finite element framework. The achievements are three-fold: First, we propose mathematically consistent definitions for the level-set transport velocity in the diffuse interface region by extrapolating the velocity from the liquid or gas phase. They exhibit superior prediction accuracy for the evaporated mass and the resulting interface dynamics compared to a local velocity evaluation, especially for strongly curved interfaces. Second, we show that accurate prediction of the evaporation-induced pressure jump requires a consistent, namely a reciprocal, density interpolation across the interface, which satisfies local mass conservation. Third, the combination of diffuse interface models for evaporation with standard Stokes-type constitutive relations for viscous flows leads to significant pressure artifacts in the diffuse interface region. To mitigate these, we propose to introduce a correction term for such constitutive model types. Through selected analytical and numerical examples, the aforementioned properties are validated. The presented model promises new insights in simulation-based prediction of melt-vapor interactions in thermal multiphase flows such as in laser-based powder bed fusion of metals.

In addition, ZnO nanoparticles are chosen for their non-trivial electrical properties. Our research demonstrates the successful extraction of 2-, 4- and 8-bit logic functions in ZnO proteinoid colloids.

Existing approaches often fully fine-tune a dual-branch encoder-decoder framework with a complicated feature fusion strategy for achieving multimodal semantic segmentation, which is training-costly due to the massive parameter updates in feature extraction and fusion. To address this issue, we propose a surprisingly simple yet effective dual-prompt learning network (dubbed DPLNet) for training-efficient multimodal (e.g., RGB-D/T) semantic segmentation. The core of DPLNet is to directly adapt a frozen pre-trained RGB model to multimodal semantic segmentation, reducing parameter updates. For this purpose, we present two prompt learning modules, comprising multimodal prompt generator (MPG) and multimodal feature adapter (MFA). MPG works to fuse the features from different modalities in a compact manner and is inserted from shadow to deep stages to generate the multi-level multimodal prompts that are injected into the frozen backbone, while MPG adapts prompted multimodal features in the frozen backbone for better multimodal semantic segmentation. Since both the MPG and MFA are lightweight, only a few trainable parameters (3.88M, 4.4% of the pre-trained backbone parameters) are introduced for multimodal feature fusion and learning. Using a simple decoder (3.27M parameters), DPLNet achieves new state-of-the-art performance or is on a par with other complex approaches on four RGB-D/T semantic segmentation datasets while satisfying parameter efficiency. Moreover, we show that DPLNet is general and applicable to other multimodal tasks such as salient object detection and video semantic segmentation. Without special design, DPLNet outperforms many complicated models. Our code will be available at github.com/ShaohuaDong2021/DPLNet.

In this regard, advanced data-driven solutions, such as Deep Learning methods, are typically required to reflect the non-linear behavior of these anomalies. As an ongoing research question related to Deep Learning, a model's applicability to limited data settings can be explored by introducing prior knowledge in the network. This same strategy can also lead to more interpretable predictions, hence facilitating the field application of the approach. For that purpose, the aim of this paper is to propose the use of Physics-informed Denoising Autoencoders (PI-DAE) for missing data imputation in commercial buildings. In particular, the presented method enforces physics-inspired soft constraints to the loss function of a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE). In order to quantify the benefits of the physical component, an ablation study between different DAE configurations is conducted. First, three univariate DAEs are optimized separately on indoor air temperature, heating, and cooling data. Then, two multivariate DAEs are derived from the previous configurations. Eventually, a building thermal balance equation is coupled to the last multivariate configuration to obtain PI-DAE. Additionally, two commonly used benchmarks are employed to support the findings. It is shown how introducing physical knowledge in a multivariate Denoising Autoencoder can enhance the inherent model interpretability through the optimized physics-based coefficients. While no significant improvement is observed in terms of reconstruction error with the proposed PI-DAE, its enhanced robustness to varying rates of missing data and the valuable insights derived from the physics-based coefficients create opportunities for wider applications within building systems and the built environment.

</span></div><div id="title">Title: <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2311.14598">Target-driven splitting SPH optimization of thermal conductivity distribution</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>Efficiently enhancing heat conduction through optimized distribution of a limited quantity of high thermal conductivity material is paramount in cooling electronic devices and numerous other applications. This paper introduces a target-driven all-at-once approach for PDE-constrained optimization and derives a splitting smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method for optimizing the distribution of thermal conductivity in heat conduction problems. In this method, the optimization iteration of the system is split into several easily addressed steps. A targeting step is employed to progressively enforce the direct target, which potentially leads to increased PDE residuals. Then, these residuals are recovered through an evolution step of the design variable. After this, a PDE solution step is carried out to further decrease the PDE residuals, and the system is ready for the next iteration. Unlike the simulation-based approaches, the present method does not rely on the adjoint state equation and converged state variable field in each iteration, and the optimization process is significantly simplified and accelerated. With the utilization of an implicit SPH splitting operator and a general numerical regularization formulation, the information propagation is further accelerated and the numerical stability is greatly enhanced. Typical examples of heat conduction optimization demonstrate that the current method yields optimal results comparable to previous methods and exhibits considerable computational efficiency. Moreover, the optimal results feature more moderate extreme values, which offers distinct advantages for the easier selection of appropriate material with high thermal conductivity.

The key to RGB-T semantic segmentation is to effectively leverage the complementarity nature of RGB and thermal images. Most existing algorithms fuse RGB and thermal information in feature space via concatenation, element-wise summation, or attention operations in either unidirectional enhancement or bidirectional aggregation manners. However, they usually overlook the modality gap between RGB and thermal images during feature fusion, resulting in modality-specific information from one modality contaminating the other. In this paper, we propose a Channel and Spatial Relation-Propagation Network (CSRPNet) for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which propagates only modality-shared information across different modalities and alleviates the modality-specific information contamination issue. Our CSRPNet first performs relation-propagation in channel and spatial dimensions to capture the modality-shared features from the RGB and thermal features. CSRPNet then aggregates the modality-shared features captured from one modality with the input feature from the other modality to enhance the input feature without the contamination issue. While being fused together, the enhanced RGB and thermal features will be also fed into the subsequent RGB or thermal feature extraction layers for interactive feature fusion, respectively. We also introduce a dual-path cascaded feature refinement module that aggregates multi-layer features to produce two refined features for semantic and boundary prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSRPNet performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms.

Most existing algorithms assume that the RGB-T image pairs are well registered, while in the real world they are not aligned ideally due to parallax or different field-of-view of the cameras. The pedestrians in misaligned image pairs may locate at different positions in two images, which results in two challenges: 1) how to achieve inter-modality complementation using spatially misaligned RGB-T pedestrian patches, and 2) how to recognize the unpaired pedestrians at the boundary. To deal with these issues, we propose a new paradigm for unregistered RGB-T pedestrian detection, which predicts two separate pedestrian locations in the RGB and thermal images, respectively. Specifically, we propose a cross-modality proposal-guided feature mining (CPFM) mechanism to extract the two precise fusion features for representing the pedestrian in the two modalities, even if the RGB-T image pair is unaligned. It enables us to effectively exploit the complementation between the two modalities. With the CPFM mechanism, we build a two-stream dense detector; it predicts the two pedestrian locations in the two modalities based on the corresponding fusion feature mined by the CPFM mechanism. Besides, we design a data augmentation method, named Homography, to simulate the discrepancy in scales and views between images. We also investigate two non-maximum suppression (NMS) methods for post-processing. Favorable experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in dealing with unregistered pedestrians with different shifts.

In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first parallel hybrid quantum-classical architecture deployed on a real-world power-plant dataset, illustrating how near-term quantum resources can already augment classical analytics in the energy sector.

Our pilot experiments show that PandaGPT can perform complex tasks such as detailed image description generation, writing stories inspired by videos, and answering questions about audios. More interestingly, PandaGPT can take multimodal inputs simultaneously and compose their semantics naturally. For example, PandaGPT can connect how objects look in an image/video and how they sound in an audio. To do so, PandaGPT combines the multimodal encoders from ImageBind and the large language models from Vicuna. Notably, only aligned image-text pairs are required for the training of PandaGPT. Thanks to the strong capability of ImageBind in embedding data from different modalities into the same space, PandaGPT displays emergent, i.e. zero-shot, cross-modal behaviors for data other than image and text (e.g., video, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU). We hope that PandaGPT serves as an initial step toward building AGI that can perceive and understand inputs in different modalities holistically, as we humans do.

In this regard, the thermal problems, performance degradation and high energy consumption, can cause irreversible damage to the devices. We address the optimization of the whole memory subsystem with three approaches integrated as a single methodology. Firstly, the thermal impact of register file is analyzed and optimized. Secondly, the cache memory is addressed by optimizing cache configuration according to running applications and improving both performance and power consumption. Finally, we simplify the design and evaluation process of general-purpose and customized dynamic memory manager, in the main memory. To this aim, we apply different evolutionary algorithms in combination with memory simulators and profiling tools. This way, we are able to evaluate the quality of each candidate solution and take advantage of the exploration of solutions given by the optimization algorithm.We also provide an experimental experience where our proposal is assessed using well-known benchmark applications.

Due to the huge amount of feasible floorplans, most of the solutions found in the literature include an evolutionary algorithm for, either partially or completely, carrying out the task of floorplanning. Evolutionary algorithms usually have a bottleneck in the fitness evaluation. In the problem of thermal-aware floorplanning, the layout evaluation by the thermal model takes 99.5\% of the computational time for the best floorplanning algorithm proposed so far.The contribution of this paper is to present a parallelization of this evaluation phase in a master$-$worker model to achieve a dramatic speed-up of the thermal-aware floorplanning process. Exhaustive experimentation was done over three dimensional integrated circuits, with 48 and 128 cores, outperforming previous published works.

Amino acid-like molecules, or proteinoids, can condense at high temperatures to create aggregation structures called proteinoid microspheres, which have been reported to exhibit strong electrical oscillations. When the amino acids L-Glutamic acid (L-Glu) and L-Aspartic acid (L-Asp) were combined with electric fields of varying frequencies and intensities, electrical activity resulted. We recorded electrical activity of the proteinoid microspheres' ensembles via a pair of differential electrodes. This is analogous to extracellular recording in physiology or EEG in neuroscience but at micro-level. We discovered that the ensembles produce spikes of electrical potential, an average duration of each spike is 26 min and average amplitude is 1 mV. The spikes are typically grouped in trains of two spikes. The electrical activity of the ensembles can be tuned by external stimulation because ensembles of proteinoid microspheres can generate and propagate electrical activity when exposed to electric fields.

Typically, their diameters range from 10 to 100 micron. Some amino acids incorporated into proteinoid chains are more hydrophobic than others, leading proteinoids to cluster together when they are present in aqueous solutions at specific concentrations, allowing them to grow into microspheres. The peculiar structure of proteinoids composed of linked amino acids endows them with unique properties, including action-potential like spiking of electrical potential. These unique properties make ensembles of proteinoid microspheres a promising substrate for designing future artificial brains and unconventional computing devices. To evaluate a potential of proteinoid microspheres for unconventional electronic devices we measure and analyse the data-transfer capacities of proteinoid microspheres. In experimental laboratory conditions we demonstrate that the transfer function of proteinoids microspheres is a nontrivial phenomenon, which might be due to the wide range of proteinoid shapes, sizes, and structures.

In contrast to many existing approaches to part-scale simulations, the underlying computational model consistently resolves physical scan tracks without additional heat source scaling, agglomeration strategies or any other heuristic modeling assumptions. A growing, adaptively refined mesh accurately captures all details of the laser beam motion. Critically, the fine spatial resolution required for resolved scan tracks in combination with the high scan velocities underlying these processes mandates the use of comparatively small time steps to resolve the underlying physics. Explicit time integration schemes are well-suited for this setting, while unconditionally stable implicit time integration schemes are employed for the interlayer cool down phase governed by significantly larger time scales. These two schemes are combined and implemented in an efficient fast operator evaluation framework providing significant performance gains and optimization opportunities. The capabilities of the novel framework are demonstrated through realistic AM examples on the centimeter scale including the first scan-resolved simulation of the entire NIST AM Benchmark cantilever specimen, with a computation time of less than one day. Apart from physical insights gained through these simulation examples, also numerical aspects are thoroughly studied on basis of weak and strong parallel scaling tests. As potential applications, the proposed thermal PBF simulation framework can serve as a basis for microstructure and thermo-mechanical predictions on the part-scale, but also to assess the influence of scan pattern and part geometry on melt pool shape and temperature, which are important indicators for well-known process instabilities.

Using the lessons learned, we develop MB2C, a novel MBRL-based HVAC control system that can achieve high control performance with excellent sample efficiency. MB2C learns the building dynamics by employing an ensemble of environment-conditioned neural networks. It then applies a new control method, Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI), for HVAC control. It produces candidate action sequences by using an importance sampling weighted algorithm that scales better to high state and action dimensions of multi-zone buildings. We evaluate MB2C using EnergyPlus simulations in a five-zone office building. The results show that MB2C can achieve 8.23% more energy savings compared to the state-of-the-art MBRL solution while maintaining similar thermal comfort. MB2C can reduce the training data set by an order of magnitude (10.52x) while achieving comparable performance to MFRL approaches.

BEVs have many advantages from a sustainability perspective, but issues such as limited driving range and long recharge times slow down the transition from combustion engines. One way to mitigate these issues is by performing battery thermal preconditioning, which increases the energy efficiency of the battery. However, to optimally perform battery thermal preconditioning, the vehicle usage pattern needs to be known, i.e., how and when the vehicle will be used. This study attempts to predict the departure time and distance of the first drive each day using online machine learning models. The online machine learning models are trained and evaluated on historical driving data collected from a fleet of BEVs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the prediction models are extended to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, which can be used to decide whether the prediction should be used or dismissed. Based on our results, the best-performing prediction models yield an aggregated mean absolute error of 2.75 hours when predicting departure time and 13.37 km when predicting trip distance.

To address this issue frequency constraints are being included in the scheduling process, which ensure a tolerable frequency deviation in case of any contingencies. In this paper, a method is proposed to integrate the non-linear frequency nadir constraint into the unit commitment problem, using machine learning. First a synthetic training dataset is generated. Then two of the available classic machine learning methods, namely logistic regression and support vector machine, are proposed to predict the frequency nadir. To be able to compare the machine learning methods to traditional frequency constrained unit commitment approaches, simulations on the power system of La Palma island are carried out for both proposed methods as well as an analytical linearized formulation of the frequency nadir. Our results show that the unit commitment problem with a machine learning based frequency nadir constraint is solved considerably faster than with the analytical formulation, while still achieving an acceptable frequency response quality after outages.

However, the scarcity of synchronized and calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study, we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day, Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

However, as planetary robots' power and thermal budgets are highly restricted, these robots need energy-efficient control approaches that easily transfer to multiple gravity environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based control approach for legged robots with gravity-scaled power-optimized reward functions. We use our approach to develop and validate a locomotion controller and a base pose controller in gravity environments from lunar gravity (1.62 m/s2) to a hypothetical super-Earth (19.62 m/s2). Our approach successfully scales across these gravity levels for locomotion and base pose control with the gravity-scaled reward functions. The power-optimized locomotion controller reached a power consumption for locomotion of 23.4 W in Earth gravity on a 15.65 kg robot at 0.4 m/s, a 23 % improvement over the baseline policy. Additionally, we designed a constant-force spring offload system that allowed us to conduct real-world experiments on legged locomotion in lunar gravity. In lunar gravity, the power-optimized control policy reached 12.2 W, 36 % less than a baseline controller which is not optimized for power efficiency. Our method provides a scalable approach to developing power-efficient locomotion controllers for legged robots across multiple gravity levels.

However, physical BMS often suffers from memory and computational resource limitations required by highfidelity models. Temperature prediction using physics-based models becomes challenging due to their higher computational time. In contrast, machine learning based approaches offer faster predictions but demand larger memory overhead. In this work, we develop a lightweight and efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) based thermal model, KAN-Therm, to predict the core temperature of a cylindrical battery. We have compared the memory overhead and computation costs of our method with Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long shortterm memory (LSTM) network.

This study investigated the influence of imagined temperature sensations (ITS) on neural activity within the sensorimotor cortex. The experimental study involved the evaluation of neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) during both real thermal stimulation (TS: 40Â°C Hot, 20Â°C Cold) applied to the participants' hand, and the mental temperature imagination (ITS) of the corresponding hot and cold sensations. The analysis focused on quantifying the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm (8-13 Hz). The experimental results revealed a characteristic mu-ERD localized over central scalp regions (e.g., C3) during both TS and ITS conditions. Although the magnitude of mu-ERD during ITS was slightly lower than during TS, this difference was not statistically significant (p>.05). However, ERD during both ITS and TS was statistically significantly different from the resting baseline (p<.001). These findings demonstrate that imagining temperature sensations engages sensorimotor cortical mechanisms in a manner comparable to actual thermal perception. This insight expands our understanding of the neurophysiological basis of sensory imagery and suggests the potential utility of ITS for non-motor BCI control and neurorehabilitation technologies.

Heat pump and thermal energy storage (HPTES) systems, being energy efficient solutions, are becoming popular in modern buildings and are promising to contribute to demand-side management (DSM) due to their significant share in household electricity consumption. For typical HPTES systems, this paper presents a systematic design framework covering a control-oriented modeling process and energy-flexible model predictive control (MPC) design. The proposed MPC-based DSM strategy offers an innovative solution for efficient DSM by following a two-step DSM framework. In the first step, flexibility assessment is performed to quantitatively evaluate the flexibility potential of the HPTES system by solving a mixed-integer economic MPC problem. In the second step, flexibility exploitation is achieved through reacting to feasible demand response (DR) requests while respecting system constraints. Both numerical simulations and real-world experiments are performed based on a real HPTES installation to showcase the viability and effectiveness of the proposed design.

To facilitate prosumer participation in the electric grid, new market mechanisms are required. In this paper, we design peer-to-peer energy markets where prosumers trade their excess energy with peers to gain profit while satisfying the overall balance in electricity supply and demand. We first consider a market structure, considering the case where voltage and/or thermal constraints are binding. When such grid constraints are binding, market clearing prices can vary across locations. However, heterogeneous prices may be considered by regulators to lack fairness. To ensure uniform pricing, we design two peer-to-peer energy markets with dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). DOEs enable us to decompose global voltage and thermal constraints across the power grid into local constraints for each prosumer, resulting in uniform prices across the grid. By means of numerical simulations on an IEEE 13-node feeder, we benchmark the proposed market-based approaches in the presence of binding voltage constraints.

To meet these demands, they rely on a combination of on-device processing and edge offloading. This letter focuses on offloading strategies for wearables by considering their impact across three time scales: instantaneous power consumption, short-term temperature fluctuations, and long-term battery duration. We introduce a comprehensive system model that captures these temporal dynamics, and propose a stochastic and stationary offloading strategy, called TAO (for temperature-aware offloading), designed to minimize the offloading cost while adhering to power, thermal, and energy constraints. Our performance evaluation, leveraging COMSOL models of real-world wearables, confirms that TAO reduces offloading cost by over 35% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, without violating the wearable operational limits.

Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets, have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions: (1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited} generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates. While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design, particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and scalable solutions for BEM.

To resolve process couplings in the resulting mathematical model, it is common to apply fully implicit time stepping. This necessitates the use of an iterative linear solver to run the model. The solver's efficiency primarily depends on a robust preconditioner, which is particularly challenging to develop because it must handle the mutual couplings between linearized contact mechanics and energy, momentum, and mass balance. In this work, we introduce a preconditioner for the problem based on the nested approximations of Schur complements. To decouple the momentum balance, we utilize the fixed-stress approximation, extended to account for both the porous media and fracture subdomains. The singularity of the contact mechanics submatrix is resolved by a linear transformation. Two variations of the algorithm are proposed to address the coupled mass and energy balance submatrix: either the Constrained Pressure Residual or the System-AMG approach. The preconditioner is evaluated through numerical experiments of fluid injection into fractured porous media, which causes thermal contraction and subsequent sliding and opening of fractures. The experiments show that the preconditioner performs robustly for a wide range of simulation regimes governed by various fracture states, friction coefficients and Peclet number. The grid refinement experiments demonstrate that the preconditioner scales well in terms of GMRES iterations, in both two and three dimensions.

Such environments significantly increase the risk of collisions, especially for tow trucks and snowplows that must remain operational in challenging conditions. Conventional driver assistance systems often struggle under these conditions due to limited visibility. In contrast, IR cameras, which detect the thermal signatures of obstacles, offer a promising alternative. The evaluation combines controlled laboratory experiments, real-world field tests, and surveys of emergency vehicle operators. In addition to assessing detection performance, the study examines the feasibility of retrofitting existing Department of Transportation (DoT) fleets with cost-effective IR-based driver assistance systems. Results underscore the utility of IR technology in enhancing driver awareness and provide data-driven recommendations for scalable deployment across legacy emergency vehicle fleets.

In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning-based RGB-T SOD method, named KAN-SAM, which reveals the potential of visual foundational models for RGB-T SOD tasks. Specifically, we extend Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for RGB-T SOD by introducing thermal features as guiding prompts through efficient and accurate Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) adapters, which effectively enhance RGB representations and improve robustness. Furthermore, we introduce a mutually exclusive random masking strategy to reduce reliance on RGB data and improve generalization. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

In this particular circumstance, there is a demand for more sophisticated and advanced technologies to implement an effective strategy for early detection, real-time monitoring, and minimizing the overall impacts of fires on ecological balance and public safety. Recently, the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) frameworks has substantially revolutionized the momentum for developing efficient fire management systems. However, these systems extensively rely on the availability of adequate and high-quality fire and smoke data to create proficient Machine Learning (ML) methods for various tasks, such as detection and monitoring. Although fire and smoke datasets play a critical role in training, evaluating, and testing advanced Deep Learning (DL) models, a comprehensive review of the existing datasets is still unexplored. For this purpose, we provide an in-depth review to systematically analyze and evaluate fire and smoke datasets collected over the past 20 years. We investigate the characteristics of each dataset, including type, size, format, collection methods, and geographical diversities. We also review and highlight the unique features of each dataset, such as imaging modalities (RGB, thermal, infrared) and their applicability for different fire management tasks (classification, segmentation, detection). Furthermore, we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each dataset and discuss their potential for advancing research and technology in fire management. Ultimately, we conduct extensive experimental analyses across different datasets using several state-of-the-art algorithms, such as ResNet-50, DeepLab-V3, and YoloV8.

Consequently, thermal infrared images are employed to reconstruct 3D models that accurately reflect the temperature distribution of a scene, aiding in applications such as building monitoring and energy management. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on static 3D reconstruction for a single time period, overlooking the impact of environmental factors on thermal radiation and failing to predict or analyze temperature variations over time. To address these challenges, we propose the NTR-Gaussian method, which treats temperature as a form of thermal radiation, incorporating elements like convective heat transfer and radiative heat dissipation. Our approach utilizes neural networks to predict thermodynamic parameters such as emissivity, convective heat transfer coefficient, and heat capacity. By integrating these predictions, we can accurately forecast thermal temperatures at various times throughout a nighttime scene. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic dataset specifically for nighttime thermal imagery. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that NTR-Gaussian significantly outperforms comparison methods in thermal reconstruction, achieving a predicted temperature error within 1 degree Celsius.

Given the high costs and logistical difficulties of real-world trials, simulators capable of capturing the operational conditions of subsea environments have become key in developing and refining algorithms for remotely-operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper highlights recent enhancements to the Stonefish simulator, an advanced open-source platform supporting development and testing of marine robotics solutions. Key updates include a suite of additional sensors, such as an event-based camera, a thermal camera, and an optical flow camera, as well as, visual light communication, support for tethered operations, improved thruster modelling, more flexible hydrodynamics, and enhanced sonar accuracy. These developments and an automated annotation tool significantly bolster Stonefish's role in marine robotics research, especially in the field of machine learning, where training data with a known ground truth is hard or impossible to collect.

To address the challenges of GPS signal interruptions or low illumination, Thermal Geo-localization (TG) employs aerial thermal imagery to align with reference satellite maps to accurately determine the UAV's location. However, existing TG methods lack uncertainty measurement in their outputs, compromising system robustness in the presence of textureless or corrupted thermal images, self-similar or outdated satellite maps, geometric noises, or thermal images exceeding satellite maps. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents UASTHN, a novel approach for Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in Deep Homography Estimation (DHE) tasks for TG applications. Specifically, we introduce a novel Crop-based Test-Time Augmentation (CropTTA) strategy, which leverages the homography consensus of cropped image views to effectively measure data uncertainty. This approach is complemented by Deep Ensembles (DE) employed for model uncertainty, offering comparable performance with improved efficiency and seamless integration with any DHE model. Extensive experiments across multiple DHE models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CropTTA in TG applications. Analysis of detected failure cases underscores the improved reliability of CropTTA under challenging conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of combining CropTTA and DE for a comprehensive assessment of both data and model uncertainty. Our research provides profound insights into the broader intersection of localization and uncertainty estimation. The code and models are publicly available.

One consequence is that a fully resolved three-dimensional analysis of these turbulent transfers at high Rayleigh numbers, which includes the boundary layers, is possible only using supercomputers. The visualization of these dynamics poses an additional hurdle since the thermal and viscous boundary layers in thermal convection fluctuate strongly. In order to track these fluctuations continuously, data must be tapped at high frequency for visualization, which is difficult to achieve using conventional methods. This paper makes two main contributions in this context. First, it discusses the simulations of turbulent Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection up to Rayleigh numbers of $Ra=10^{12}$ computed with NekRS on GPUs. The largest simulation was run on 840 nodes with 3360 GPU on the JUWELS Booster supercomputer. Secondly, an in-situ workflow using ASCENT is presented, which was successfully used to visualize the high-frequency turbulent fluctuations.

The crucial properties that such magnetic descriptors must satisfy are differentiability with respect to spin rotations and invariance to both lattice point-group symmetry and internal spin rotation symmetry. We propose an efficient implementation based on the concept of reference irreducible representations, modified from the group-theoretical power-spectrum and bispectrum methods. The ML framework is demonstrated using the s-d models, which are widely applied in spintronics research. We show that LLG simulations based on local fields predicted by the trained ML models successfully reproduce representative non-collinear spin structures, including 120$^\circ$, tetrahedral, and skyrmion crystal orders of the triangular-lattice s-d models. Large-scale thermal quench simulations enabled by ML models further reveal intriguing freezing dynamics and glassy stripe states consisting of skyrmions and bi-merons. Our work highlights the utility of ML force-field approach to dynamical modeling of complex spin orders in itinerant electron magnets.

Since ISC in one of the modules inside a battery pack can eventually lead to thermal runaway, it is crucial to detect its early onset. However, the inaccuracy and aging variability of battery models and the unavailability of adequate ISC datasets pose several challenges for both model-based and data-driven approaches. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a model-free Koopman Mode-based module-level ISC detection algorithm for battery packs. The algorithm adopts two parallel Koopman mode generation schemes with the Arnoldi algorithm to capture the Kullback-Leibler divergence-based distributional deviations in Koopman mode statistics in the presence of ISC. Our proposed algorithm utilizes module-level voltage measurements to accurately identify the shorted battery module of the pack without using specific battery models or pre-training with historical battery data. Furthermore, we presented two case studies on shorted battery module detection under both resting and charging conditions. The simulation results illustrated the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm toward ISC and the robustness against measurement noise.

However, the computational complexity of solving a receding horizon problem at each time step remains a challenge for the deployment of MPC. This is particularly the case for systems constrained by many inequalities. Recently, we introduced the concept of constraint-adaptive MPC (ca-MPC) to address this challenge for linear systems with hard constraints. In ca-MPC, at each time step, a subset of the constraints is removed from the optimization problem, thereby accelerating the optimization procedure, while resulting in identical closed-loop behavior. The present paper extends this framework to soft-constrained MPC by detecting and removing constraints based on sub-optimal predicted input sequences, which is rather easy for soft-constrained MPC due to the receding horizon principle and the inclusion of slack variables. We will translate these new ideas explicitly to an offset-free output tracking problem. The effectiveness of these ideas is demonstrated on a two-dimensional thermal transport model, showing a three order of magnitude improvement in online computational time of the MPC scheme.

Our approach is based on the non-perturbative frozen phonon formulation in which stochastic Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to sample configurations of nuclei in a supercell at finite temperatures based on a first-principles phonon model. A deep-learning neural network is trained to accurately predict physical properties associated with sampled phonon configurations, thus bypassing the time-consuming {\em ab initio} calculations. To incorporate the point-group symmetry of the electronic system into the ML model, group-theoretical methods are used to develop a symmetry-invariant descriptor for phonon configurations in the supercell. We apply our ML approach to compute the temperature dependent electronic energy gap of silicon based on density functional theory (DFT). We show that, with less than a hundred DFT calculations for training the neural network model, an order of magnitude larger number of sampling can be achieved for the computation of the vibrational thermal expectation values. Our work highlights the promising potential of ML techniques for finite temperature first-principles electronic structure methods.

Our focus is on investigating the predictability of the energy demand of the heating system and of the thermal response when varying the heating system settings. Being able to form such predictions is crucial for most flexible demand algorithms. We will compare several methods for predicting the thermal and energy response, which either gave good results or which are currently promoted in the literature for controlling buildings. We will report that the stochasticity of a house response is -- in our experience -- the main difficulty in providing domestic flexible demand from heating. The experiments were carried out on a regular house in Norway, equipped with four air-to-air Mitsubishi heat pumps and a high-efficiency balanced ventilation system. The house was equipped with multiple IoT-based climate sensors, real-time power measurement, and the possibility to drive the HVAC system via the IoT. The house is operating on the spot market (Nord Pool NO3) and is exposed to a peak energy demand penalty. Over a period of three years, we have collected data on the house (temperatures, humidity, air quality), real-time power and hourly energy consumption, while applying various flexible demand algorithms responding to the local energy costs. This has produced large variations in the settings of the heating system and energy demand, resulting in rich data for investigating the house response. This chapter aims at providing important insights on providing flexible demand from houses in cold climates.

Large scale dynamical simulations of the JT model also shed light on the orbital ordering dynamics in colossal magnetoresistance manganites. The JT effect in these materials describes the distortion of local oxygen octahedra driven by a coupling to the orbital degrees of freedom of $e_g$ electrons. An effective electron-mediated interaction between the local JT modes leads to a structural transition and the emergence of long-range orbital order at low temperatures. Assuming the principle of locality, a deep-learning neural-network model is developed to accurately and efficiently predict the electron-induced forces that drive the dynamical evolution of JT phonons. A group-theoretical method is utilized to develop a descriptor that incorporates the combined orbital and lattice symmetry into the ML model. Large-scale Langevin dynamics simulations, enabled by the ML force-field models, are performed to investigate the coarsening dynamics of the composite JT distortion and orbital order after a thermal quench. The late-stage coarsening of orbital domains exhibits pronounced freezing behaviors which are likely related to the unusual morphology of the domain structures. Our work highlights a promising avenue for multi-scale dynamical modeling of correlated electron systems.

In-situ monitoring of the melt pool subsurface morphology requires specialized equipment that may not be readily accessible or scalable. Therefore, we introduce a machine learning framework to correlate in-situ two-color thermal images observed via high-speed color imaging to the two-dimensional profile of the melt pool cross-section. Specifically, we employ a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture to establish a correlation between single bead off-axis thermal image sequences and melt pool cross-section contours measured via optical microscopy. In this architecture, a ResNet model embeds the spatial information contained within the thermal images to a latent vector, while a Transformer model correlates the sequence of embedded vectors to extract temporal information. Our framework is able to model the curvature of the subsurface melt pool structure, with improved performance in high energy density regimes compared to analytical melt pool models. The performance of this model is evaluated through dimensional and geometric comparisons to the corresponding experimental melt pool observations.

Still, there has been less research on how autonomous vehicles could detect slippery driving conditions on the road to drive safely. In this work, we propose a method to predict a dense grip map from the area in front of the car, based on postprocessed multimodal sensor data. We trained a convolutional neural network to predict pixelwise grip values from fused RGB camera, thermal camera, and LiDAR reflectance images, based on weakly supervised ground truth from an optical road weather sensor.
  The experiments show that it is possible to predict dense grip values with good accuracy from the used data modalities as the produced grip map follows both ground truth measurements and local weather conditions, such as snowy areas on the road. The model using only the RGB camera or LiDAR reflectance modality provided good baseline results for grip prediction accuracy while using models fusing the RGB camera, thermal camera, and LiDAR modalities improved the grip predictions significantly.

Our goal is to build the real time porosity map of parts based on thermal images acquired during the build. The quantification task builds upon the established Convolutional Neural Network model architecture to predict pore count and the localization task leverages the spatial and temporal attention mechanisms of the novel Video Vision Transformer model to indicate areas of expected porosity. Our model for porosity quantification achieved a $R^2$ score of 0.57 and our model for porosity localization produced an average IoU score of 0.32 and a maximum of 1.0. This work is setting the foundations of part porosity "Digital Twins" based on additive manufacturing monitoring data and can be applied downstream to reduce time-intensive post-inspection and testing activities during part qualification and certification. In addition, we seek to accelerate the acquisition of crucial insights normally only available through ex-situ part evaluation by means of machine learning analysis of in-situ process monitoring data.

However, sensor noises will contaminate low-value pixel signals, and the lossy camera image signal processor will further remove near-zero intensities in extremely dark situations, deteriorating the synthesis performance. Existing approaches reconstruct low-light scenes from raw images but struggle to recover texture and boundary details in dark regions. Additionally, they are unsuitable for high-speed models relying on explicit representations. To address these issues, we present Thermal-NeRF, which takes thermal and visible raw images as inputs, considering the thermal camera is robust to the illumination variation and raw images preserve any possible clues in the dark, to accomplish visible and thermal view synthesis simultaneously. Also, the first multi-view thermal and visible dataset (MVTV) is established to support the research on multimodal NeRF. Thermal-NeRF achieves the best trade-off between detail preservation and noise smoothing and provides better synthesis performance than previous work. Finally, we demonstrate that both modalities are beneficial to each other in 3D reconstruction.

In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of neural scene representations, such as NeRFs, in the context of multi-modal learning. Specifically, we present four different strategies of how to incorporate a second modality, other than RGB, into NeRFs: (1) training from scratch independently on both modalities; (2) pre-training on RGB and fine-tuning on the second modality; (3) adding a second branch; and (4) adding a separate component to predict (color) values of the additional modality. We chose thermal imaging as second modality since it strongly differs from RGB in terms of radiosity, making it challenging to integrate into neural scene representations. For the evaluation of the proposed strategies, we captured a new publicly available multi-view dataset, ThermalMix, consisting of six common objects and about 360 RGB and thermal images in total. We employ cross-modality calibration prior to data capturing, leading to high-quality alignments between RGB and thermal images. Our findings reveal that adding a second branch to NeRF performs best for novel view synthesis on thermal images while also yielding compelling results on RGB. Finally, we also show that our analysis generalizes to other modalities, including near-infrared images and depth maps. Project page: https://mert-o.github.io/ThermalNeRF/.

A canonical example is the anomalous quantum Hall state with a chiral spin order stabilized by electron-spin interactions on a triangular lattice. While a long-range magnetic order cannot survive thermal fluctuations in two dimensions, the chiral order which results from the breaking of a discrete Ising symmetry persists even at finite temperatures. We present a scalable machine learning (ML) framework to model the complex electron-mediated spin-spin interactions that stabilize the chiral magnetic domains in a triangular lattice. Large-scale dynamical simulations, enabled by the ML force-field models, are performed to investigate the coarsening of chiral domains after a thermal quench. While the chiral phase is described by a broken $Z_2$ Ising-type symmetry, we find that the characteristic size of chiral domains increases linearly with time, in stark contrast to the expected Allen-Cahn domain growth law for a non-conserved Ising order parameter field. The linear growth of the chiral domains is attributed to the orientational anisotropy of domain boundaries. Our work also demonstrates the promising potential of ML models for large-scale spin dynamics of itinerant magnets.

With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into modern power grids, demand-side management (DSM) becomes crucial for balancing power generation and consumption by adjusting end users' power consumption. This paper explores an energy flexible Model Predictive Control (MPC) design for a class of HPTES systems to facilitate demand-side management. The proposed DSM strategy comprises two key components: i) flexibility assessment, and ii) flexibility exploitation. Firstly, for flexibility assessment, a tailored MPC formulation, supplemented by a set of auxiliary linear constraints, is developed to quantitatively assess the flexibility potential inherent in HPTES systems. Subsequently, in flexibility exploitation, the energy flexibility is effectively harnessed in response to feasible demand response (DR) requests, which can be formulated as a standard mixed-integer MPC problem. Numerical experiments, based on a real-world HPTES installation, are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed design.

Novel sensors, such as event and thermal cameras, offer capabilities with the potential to address these scenarios, but they remain to be fully exploited. This paper introduces the Novel Sensors for Autonomous Vehicle Perception (NSAVP) dataset to facilitate future research on this topic. The dataset was captured with a platform including stereo event, thermal, monochrome, and RGB cameras as well as a high precision navigation system providing ground truth poses. The data was collected by repeatedly driving two ~8 km routes and includes varied lighting conditions and opposing viewpoint perspectives. We provide benchmarking experiments on the task of place recognition to demonstrate challenges and opportunities for novel sensors to enhance critical AV perception tasks.

This intensive requirement renders traditional checkpointing methods ineffective due to the significant slowdown in simulations while saving state data to disk. As we progress towards exascale and GPU-driven High-Performance Computing (HPC) and confront larger problem sizes, the choice becomes increasingly stark: to compromise data fidelity or to reduce resolution. To navigate this challenge, this study advocates for the use of in situ analysis and visualization techniques. These allow more frequent data "snapshots" to be taken directly from memory, thus avoiding the need for disruptive checkpointing. We detail our approach of instrumenting NekRS, a GPU-focused thermal-fluid simulation code employing the spectral element method (SEM), and describe varied in situ and in transit strategies for data rendering. Additionally, we provide concrete scientific use-cases and report on runs performed on Polaris, Argonne Leadership Computing Facility's (ALCF) 44 Petaflop supercomputer and JÃ¼lich Wizard for European Leadership Science (JUWELS) Booster, JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre's (JSC) 71 Petaflop High Performance Computing (HPC) system, offering practical insight into the implications of our methodology.

Most of the existing research follows a single-step price- or incentive-based scheme for unlocking the flexibility potential of buildings. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel two-step design approach for better harnessing buildings' energy flexibility. In a first step, a robust optimization model is formulated for assessing the energy flexibility of buildings in the presence of uncertain predictions of external conditions, such as ambient temperature, solar irradiation, etc. In a second step, energy flexibility is activated in response to a feasible demand response (DR) request from grid operators without violating indoor temperature constraints, even in the presence of uncertain external conditions. The proposed approach is tested on a high-fidelity Modelica simulator to evaluate its effectiveness. Simulation results show that, compared with price-based demand-side management, the proposed approach achieves greater energy reduction during peak hours.

It is worth noting that this field is still in its infancy, with relatively limited research conducted in this specific area to date, especially when it comes for data-driven approaches. In this paper we introduce a novel physics-informed neural network model for addressing this problem. Through the employment of unexposed datasets that encompass general building information, audited characteristics, and heating energy consumption, we feed the deep learning model with general building information, while the model's output consists of the structural components and several thermal properties that are in fact the basic elements of an energy performance certificate (EPC). On top of this neural network, a function, based on physics equations, calculates the energy consumption of the building based on heat losses and enhances the loss function of the deep learning model. This methodology is tested on a real case study for 256 buildings located in Riga, Latvia. Our investigation comes up with promising results in terms of prediction accuracy, paving the way for automated, and data-driven energy efficiency performance prediction based on basic properties of the building, contrary to exhaustive energy efficiency audits led by humans, which are the current status quo.

Compared to the matured development pipeline of RGB-input (source modality) models, developing non-RGB-input (target-modality) models from scratch poses excessive challenges in the modality-specific network design/training tricks and labor in the target-modality annotation. In this paper, we propose ModAlity Calibration (MAC), an efficient pipeline for calibrating target-modality inputs to the DNN object detection models developed on the RGB (source) modality. We compose a target-modality-input model by adding a small calibrator module ahead of a source-modality model and introduce MAC training techniques to impose dense supervision on the calibrator. By leveraging (1) prior knowledge synthesized from the source-modality model and (2) paired {target, source} data with zero manual annotations, our target-modality models reach comparable or better metrics than baseline models that require 100% manual annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MAC by composing the WiFi-input, Lidar-input, and Thermal-Infrared-input models upon the pre-trained RGB-input models respectively.

Clock synchronization provides unified time reference, which is critical to the deterministic communication of TSN. However, changes in internal network status and external work environments of devices both degrade practical synchronization performance. This paper proposes a temperature-resilient architecture considering delay asymmetry (TACD) to enhance the timing accuracy under the impacts of internal delay and external thermal changes. In TACD, an anti-delay-asymmetry method is developed, which employs a partial variational Bayesian algorithm to promote adaptability to non-stationary delay variation. An optimized skew estimator is further proposed, fusing the temperature skew model for ambiance perception with the traditional linear clock model to compensate for nonlinear error caused by temperature changes. Theoretical derivation of skew estimation lower bound proves the promotion of optimal accuracy after the fusion of clock models. Evaluations based on measured delay data demonstrate accuracy advantages regardless of internal or external influences.

Recent emerging data-driven techniques greatly relieve human reliance by automatic modeling from simulation data. However, model discrepancy may occur due to unmodeled parasitics, deficient thermal and magnetic models, unpredictable ambient conditions, etc. These inaccurate data-driven models based on pure simulation cannot represent the practical performance in physical world, hindering their applications in power converter modeling. To alleviate model discrepancy and improve accuracy in practice, this paper proposes a novel data-driven modeling with experimental augmentation (D2EA), leveraging both simulation data and experimental data. In D2EA, simulation data aims to establish basic functional landscape, and experimental data focuses on matching actual performance in real world. The D2EA approach is instantiated for the efficiency optimization of a hybrid modulation for neutral-point-clamped dual-active-bridge (NPC-DAB) converter. The proposed D2EA approach realizes 99.92% efficiency modeling accuracy, and its feasibility is comprehensively validated in 2-kW hardware experiments, where the peak efficiency of 98.45% is attained. Overall, D2EA is data-light and can achieve highly accurate and highly practical data-driven models in one shot, and it is scalable to other applications, effortlessly.

Traditional methods mostly use RGB images which are heavily affected by lighting conditions, \eg, darkness. Recent studies show thermal images are robust to the night scenario as a compensating modality for segmentation. However, existing works either simply fuse RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) images or adopt the encoder with the same structure for both the RGB stream and the thermal stream, which neglects the modality difference in segmentation under varying lighting conditions. Therefore, this work proposes a Residual Spatial Fusion Network (RSFNet) for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Specifically, we employ an asymmetric encoder to learn the compensating features of the RGB and the thermal images. To effectively fuse the dual-modality features, we generate the pseudo-labels by saliency detection to supervise the feature learning, and develop the Residual Spatial Fusion (RSF) module with structural re-parameterization to learn more promising features by spatially fusing the cross-modality features. RSF employs a hierarchical feature fusion to aggregate multi-level features, and applies the spatial weights with the residual connection to adaptively control the multi-spectral feature fusion by the confidence gate. Extensive experiments were carried out on two benchmarks, \ie, MFNet database and PST900 database. The results have shown the state-of-the-art segmentation performance of our method, which achieves a good balance between accuracy and speed.

Since GPS can suffer from signal loss and spoofing problems, researchers have explored camera-based techniques such as Visual Geo-localization (VG) using satellite RGB imagery. Additionally, thermal geo-localization (TG) has become crucial for long-range UAV flights in low-illumination environments. This paper proposes a novel thermal geo-localization framework using satellite RGB imagery, which includes multiple domain adaptation methods to address the limited availability of paired thermal and satellite images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving reliable thermal geo-localization performance, even in thermal images with indistinct self-similar features. We evaluate our approach on real data collected onboard a UAV. We also release the code and \textit{Boson-nighttime}, a dataset of paired satellite-thermal and unpaired satellite images for thermal geo-localization with satellite imagery.

Generally, large amounts of labeled data are required to guarantee a good prediction performance of the surrogate model, especially the deep learning model, which have more parameters and better representational ability. However, labeled data, especially high-fidelity labeled data, are usually expensive to obtain and sometimes even impossible. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a pithy deep multi-fidelity model (DMFM) for temperature field prediction, which takes advantage of low-fidelity data to boost the performance with less high-fidelity data. First, a pre-train and fine-tune paradigm are developed in DMFM to train the low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, which significantly reduces the complexity of the deep surrogate model. Then, a self-supervised learning method for training the physics-driven deep multi-fidelity model (PD-DMFM) is proposed, which fully utilizes the physics characteristics of the engineering systems and reduces the dependence on large amounts of labeled low-fidelity data in the training process. Two diverse temperature field prediction problems are constructed to validate the effectiveness of DMFM and PD-DMFM, and the result shows that the proposed method can greatly reduce the dependence of the model on high-fidelity data.

Existing works leverage contact maps to refine inaccurate hand-object pose estimations and generate grasps given object models. However, they require explicit 3D supervision which is seldom available and therefore, are limited to constrained settings, e.g., where thermal cameras observe residual heat left on manipulated objects. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised framework that allows us to learn contact from monocular images. Specifically, we leverage visual and geometric consistency constraints in large-scale datasets for generating pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning and propose an efficient graph-based network to infer contact. Our semi-supervised learning framework achieves a favourable improvement over the existing supervised learning methods trained on data with `limited' annotations. Notably, our proposed model is able to achieve superior results with less than half the network parameters and memory access cost when compared with the commonly-used PointNet-based approach. We show benefits from using a contact map that rules hand-object interactions to produce more accurate reconstructions. We further demonstrate that training with pseudo-labels can extend contact map estimations to out-of-domain objects and generalise better across multiple datasets.

In Laser Powder Bed Fusion, a specific part is built in an iterative manner in which two-dimensional cross-sections are formed on top of each other by melting and fusing the proper areas of the powder bed. In this process, the behavior of the melt pool and its thermal field has a very important role in predicting the quality of the manufactured part and its possible defects. However, the simulation of such a complex phenomenon is usually very time-consuming and requires huge computational resources. Flow-3D is one of the software packages capable of executing such simulations using iterative numerical solvers. In this work, we create three datasets of single-trail processes using Flow-3D and use them to train a convolutional neural network capable of predicting the behavior of the three-dimensional thermal field of the melt pool solely by taking three parameters as input: laser power, laser velocity, and time step. The CNN achieves a relative Root Mean Squared Error of 2% to 3% for the temperature field and an average Intersection over Union score of 80% to 90% in predicting the melt pool area. Moreover, since time is included as one of the inputs of the model, the thermal field can be instantly obtained for any arbitrary time step without the need to iterate and compute all the steps

Experimental determination of thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover, existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of 24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a 1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

Exploiting high electromechanical coupling, good thermal properties, and enhanced and selective IR absorption, the presented device aims to demonstrate significant advancements over the state-of-the-art IR RTDs. This single pixel combines compact footprint, high spectral selectivity and responsivity, reduced noise, and fast thermal response, allowing for the potential development of innovative IR thermal imagers through multi-pixel integration. The flexural nature of the actuated resonance mode eventually enables an interferometric optical readout, paving the way towards achieving extremely low Noise Equivalent Power levels. These results demonstrate a high IR responsivity of around 130 ppt/pW, a thermal time constant of around 330 us, and a large out-of-plane displacement. This work represents the first experimental integration on a resonating platform of plasmonic absorbers that utilize AlScN as dielectric layer.

Previously fabricated CLMR devices failed at approximately 8 dBm of input power, primarily due to electromigration in the aluminum interdigitated electrodes (IDTs). To better understand this mechanism in CLMRs, a data driven thermal model is developed to analyze localized heating effects within the resonator body, which are known to accelerate electromigration. Based on insights from this model, Aluminum Silicon Copper (AlSiCu) was selected for the IDTs due to its superior thermal stability and resistance to electromigration. Devices fabricated with AlSiCu exhibited no signs of performance degradation, with the best-performing resonator achieving a mechanical quality factor (Qm) of 360, a maximum Bode quality factor (QBode) of 500, and an electromechanical coupling coefficient (kt2) of 6.3%. Moreover, the use of AlSiCu significantly increased the maximum input power the device can withstand, showing an improvement of up to 6 dBm over previous devices. These improvements in power handling make the devices strong candidates for high-power Ku-band filtering applications.

By combining empirical measurements from Brookhaven National Laboratory during AI training on 8-GPU H100 systems with open-source benchmarking data, we develop statistical models relating computational intensity to node-level power consumption. We measure the gap between manufacturer-rated thermal design power (TDP) and actual power demand during AI training. Our analysis reveals that even computationally intensive workloads operate at only 76% of the 10.2 kW TDP rating. Our architecture-specific model, calibrated to floating-point operations, predicts energy consumption with 11.4% mean absolute percentage error, significantly outperforming TDP-based approaches (27-37% error). We identified distinct power signatures between transformer and CNN architectures, with transformers showing characteristic fluctuations that may impact grid stability.

However, in real-world applications, they remain vulnerable to internal short circuits (ISCs) and the consequential risk of thermal runaway (TR). Toward addressing the challenge of ISCs and TR, we undertake a systematic study that extends from dynamic modeling to fault detection in this paper. First, we develop {\em BattBee}, the first equivalent circuit model to specifically describe the onset of ISCs and the evolution of subsequently induced TR. Drawing upon electrochemical modeling, the model can simulate ISCs at different severity levels and predict their impact on the initiation and progression of TR events. With the physics-inspired design, this model offers strong physical interpretability and predictive accuracy, while maintaining structural simplicity to allow fast computation. Then, building upon the BattBee model, we develop fault detection observers and derive detection criteria together with decision-making logics to identify the occurrence and emergence of ISC and TR events. This detection approach is principled in design and fast in computation, lending itself to practical applications. Validation based on simulations and experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of both the BattBee model and the ISC/TR detection approach. The research outcomes underscore this study's potential for real-world battery safety risk management.

Current systems frequently avoid local model storage by sending queries to a server, incurring uplink cost, network latency, and privacy risk. We present the opposite approach: broadcasting model weights to clients that perform inference locally using in-physics computation inside the radio receive chain. A base station transmits weights as radio frequency (RF) waveforms; the client encodes activations onto the waveform and computes the result using existing mixer and filter stages, RF components already present in billions of edge devices such as cellphones, eliminating repeated signal conversions and extra hardware. Analysis shows that thermal noise and nonlinearity create an optimal energy window for accurate analog inner products. Hardware-tailored training through a differentiable RF chain preserves accuracy within this regime. Circuit-informed simulations, consistent with a companion experiment, demonstrate reduced memory and conversion overhead while maintaining high accuracy in realistic wireless edge scenarios.

We demonstrate that our architecture is able to estimate all the needed matrix elements with just a single training for a fixed time discretization and lattice volume. Our method can be applied to other types of spin chains, possibly with defects, as well as to estimating entanglement entropies of thermal states at non-zero temperature.

Thermal cameras, which capture long-wave infrared radiation, are able to function effectively in darkness and smoke, where visible-light cameras fail. This work explores learned cross-spectral (thermal-visible) point features as a means to integrate thermal imagery into established camera-based navigation systems. Existing methods typically train a feature network's detection and description outputs directly, which often focuses training on image regions where thermal and visible-spectrum images exhibit similar appearance. Aiming to more fully utilize the available data, we propose a method to train the feature network on the tasks of matching and registration. We run our feature network on thermal-visible image pairs, then feed the network response into a differentiable registration pipeline. Losses are applied to the matching and registration estimates of this pipeline. Our selected model, trained on the task of matching, achieves a registration error (corner error) below 10 pixels for more than 75% of estimates on the MultiPoint dataset. We further demonstrate that our model can also be used with a classical pipeline for matching and registration.

Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

However, the efficacy of such strategies is influenced by the background climate and their implementation may potentially alter both the indoor climate and local urban climate. This study proposes an integrated framework combining RL with an urban climate model that incorporates a building energy model, aiming to evaluate the efficacy of RL-based HVAC control across different background climates, impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate, and the transferability of RL strategies across cities. Our findings reveal that the reward (defined as a weighted combination of energy consumption and thermal comfort) and the impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate exhibit marked variability across cities with different background climates. The sensitivity of reward weights and the transferability of RL strategies are also strongly influenced by the background climate. Cities in hot climates tend to achieve higher rewards across most reward weight configurations that balance energy consumption and thermal comfort, and those cities with more varying atmospheric temperatures demonstrate greater RL strategy transferability. These findings underscore the importance of thoroughly evaluating RL-based HVAC control strategies in diverse climatic contexts. This study also provides a new insight that city-to-city learning will potentially aid the deployment of RL-based HVAC control.

Specifically, we introduce the Motion Mamba module into the Siamese architecture to ex-tract motion features and recover overlooked edge details using bidirectional modeling and self-attention. We propose a Siamese parameter-sharing strate-gy that allows certain convolutional layers to share weights. This approach reduces computational redundancy while preserving strong feature represen-tation. In addition, we design a motion edge-aware regression loss to improve tracking accuracy, especially for motion-blurred targets. Extensive experi-ments are conducted on four TIR tracking benchmarks, including LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR 2017. The results show that SMMT achieves superior performance in TIR target tracking.

In this paper, we propose a novel tracker, SMTT, which effectively addresses common challenges in thermal infrared imagery, such as noise, occlusion, and rapid target motion, by leveraging multi-task learning, joint sparse representation, and adaptive graph regularization. By reformulating the tracking task as a multi-task learning problem, the SMTT tracker independently optimizes the representation of each particle while dynamically capturing spatial and feature-level similarities using a weighted mixed-norm regularization strategy. To ensure real-time performance, we incorporate the Accelerated Proximal Gradient method for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets - including VOT-TIR, PTB-TIR, and LSOTB-TIR - demonstrate that SMTT achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. These results highlight SMTT as a reliable and high-performance solution for thermal infrared target tracking in complex environments.

However, the low resolution of TIR images, along with tracking interference, significantly limits the perfor-mance of TIR trackers. To address these challenges, we introduce STARS, a novel sparse learning-based CF tracker that incorporates spatio-temporal regulari-zation and super-resolution reconstruction. First, we apply adaptive sparse filter-ing and temporal domain filtering to extract key features of the target while reduc-ing interference from background clutter and noise. Next, we introduce an edge-preserving sparse regularization method to stabilize target features and prevent excessive blurring. This regularization integrates multiple terms and employs the alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize the solution. Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that STARS outperforms state-of-the-art trackers in terms of robustness.

First, we introduce a cross-channel fine-grained feature learning network that employs masks and suppression coefficients to suppress dominant target features, en-abling the tracker to capture more detailed and subtle information. The net-work employs a channel rearrangement mechanism to enhance efficient in-formation flow, coupled with channel equalization to reduce parameter count. Additionally, we incorporate layer-by-layer combination units for ef-fective feature extraction and fusion, thereby minimizing parameter redun-dancy and computational complexity. The network further employs feature redirection and channel shuffling strategies to better integrate fine-grained details. Second, we propose a specialized cross-channel fine-grained loss function designed to guide feature groups toward distinct discriminative re-gions of the target, thus improving overall target representation. This loss function includes an inter-channel loss term that promotes orthogonality be-tween channels, maximizing feature diversity and facilitating finer detail capture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed tracker achieves the highest accuracy, scoring 0.81 on the VOT-TIR 2015 and 0.78 on the VOT-TIR 2017 benchmark, while also outperforming other methods across all evaluation metrics on the LSOTB-TIR and PTB-TIR benchmarks.

As a result, trackers are often affected by interference from visually similar objects and are susceptible to tracking drift. To address these challenges, we propose a novel saliency-guided Siamese network tracker based on key fine-grained feature infor-mation. First, we introduce a fine-grained feature parallel learning convolu-tional block with a dual-stream architecture and convolutional kernels of varying sizes. This design captures essential global features from shallow layers, enhances feature diversity, and minimizes the loss of fine-grained in-formation typically encountered in residual connections. In addition, we propose a multi-layer fine-grained feature fusion module that uses bilinear matrix multiplication to effectively integrate features across both deep and shallow layers. Next, we introduce a Siamese residual refinement block that corrects saliency map prediction errors using residual learning. Combined with deep supervision, this mechanism progressively refines predictions, ap-plying supervision at each recursive step to ensure consistent improvements in accuracy. Finally, we present a saliency loss function to constrain the sali-ency predictions, directing the network to focus on highly discriminative fi-ne-grained features. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the pro-posed tracker achieves the highest precision and success rates on the PTB-TIR and LSOTB-TIR benchmarks.

However, ex-isting methods struggle with challenges such as low-resolution imagery, occlu-sion, background clutter, and target deformation, which severely impact tracking performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose RAMCT, a region-adaptive sparse correlation filter tracker that integrates multi-channel feature opti-mization with an adaptive regularization strategy. Firstly, we refine the CF learn-ing process by introducing a spatially adaptive binary mask, which enforces spar-sity in the target region while dynamically suppressing background interference. Secondly, we introduce generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) and propose a novel GSVD-based region-adaptive iterative Tikhonov regularization method. This enables flexible and robust optimization across multiple feature channels, improving resilience to occlusion and background variations. Thirdly, we propose an online optimization strategy with dynamic discrepancy-based pa-rameter adjustment. This mechanism facilitates real time adaptation to target and background variations, thereby improving tracking accuracy and robustness. Ex-tensive experiments on LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR2017 benchmarks demonstrate that RAMCT outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers in terms of accuracy and robustness.

  However, similar to most RGBT fusion tasks, it still mainly relies on manually aligned multimodal image pairs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel Multimodal Spatio-temporal Graph learning Network (MSGNet) for alignment-free RGBT VOD problem by leveraging the robust graph representation learning model.
  Specifically, we first design an Adaptive Partitioning Layer (APL) to estimate the corresponding regions of the Thermal image within the RGB image (high-resolution), achieving a preliminary inexact alignment.
  Then, we introduce the Spatial Sparse Graph Learning Module (S-SGLM) which employs a sparse information passing mechanism on the estimated inexact alignment to achieve reliable information interaction between different modalities.
  Moreover, to fully exploit the temporal cues for RGBT VOD problem, we introduce Hybrid Structured Temporal Modeling (HSTM), which involves a Temporal Sparse Graph Learning Module (T-SGLM) and Temporal Star Block (TSB). T-SGLM aims to filter out some redundant information between adjacent frames by employing the sparse aggregation mechanism on the temporal graph. Meanwhile, TSB is dedicated to achieving the complementary learning of local spatial relationships.
  Extensive comparative experiments conducted on both the aligned dataset VT-VOD50 and the unaligned dataset UVT-VOD2024 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our project will be made available on our website for free public access.

Both electromagnetic and thermal analyses are relevant for foil windings. These two physical areas are coupled through Joule losses and temperature dependent material properties. For an efficient simulation of foil windings, homogenization techniques are used to avoid resolving the single turns. Therefore, this paper comprises a coupled magneto-thermal simulation that uses a homogenization method in the electromagnetic and thermal part. A weak coupling with different time step sizes for both parts is presented. The method is validated on a simple geometry and showcased for a pot transformer that uses a foil and a wire winding.

To date, high-density (HD) SRAM has been the conventional device of choice; however, with the slowing of transistor scaling, as reflected in the industry's almost identical HD SRAM cell size from 5 nm to 3 nm, alternative solutions such as 3D stacking with advanced packaging like hybrid bonding are pursued (as demonstrated in AMD's V-cache). Escalating data demands necessitate ultra-large on-chip caches to decrease costly off-chip memory movement, pushing the exploration of device technology toward monolithic 3D (M3D) integration where transistors can be stacked in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) at the interconnect level. M3D integration requires fabrication techniques compatible with a low thermal budget (<400 degC). Among promising BEOL device candidates are amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors, particularly desirable for their ultra-low leakage (<fA/um), enabling persistent data retention (>seconds) when used in a gain-cell configuration. This paper examines device, circuit, and system-level tradeoffs when optimizing BEOL-compatible AOS-based 2-transistor gain cell (2T-GC) for LLC. A cache early-exploration tool, NS-Cache, is developed to model caches in advanced 7 and 3 nm nodes and is integrated with the Gem5 simulator to systematically benchmark the impact of the newfound density/performance when compared to HD-SRAM, MRAM, and 1T1C eDRAM alternatives for LLC.

However, lower errors on held out test sets do not always translate to improved results on downstream physical property prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose testing MLIPs on their practical ability to conserve energy during molecular dynamic simulations. If passed, improved correlations are found between test errors and their performance on physical property prediction tasks. We identify choices which may lead to models failing this test, and use these observations to improve upon highly-expressive models. The resulting model, eSEN, provides state-of-the-art results on a range of physical property prediction tasks, including materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity prediction, and phonon calculations.

However, the performance and accuracy of on-device LLMs in real-world medical contexts remain underexplored. In this study, we benchmark publicly available on-device LLMs using the AMEGA dataset, evaluating accuracy, computational efficiency, and thermal limitation across various mobile devices. Our results indicate that compact general-purpose models like Phi-3 Mini achieve a strong balance between speed and accuracy, while medically fine-tuned models such as Med42 and Aloe attain the highest accuracy. Notably, deploying LLMs on older devices remains feasible, with memory constraints posing a greater challenge than raw processing power. Our study underscores the potential of on-device LLMs for healthcare while emphasizing the need for more efficient inference and models tailored to real-world clinical reasoning.

A goal is the better utilization of the machines with reduced safety margins due to a better knowledge of the critical conditions. In this work, the parameters of a two-dimensional induction machine model are calibrated according to evidence from measurements, by solving an inverse field problem. The set of parameters comprise material parameters as well as parameters that model three-dimensional effects. This allows a consideration of physical effects without explicit knowledge of its quantities. First, the accuracy of the approach is studied using an academic example in combination with synthetic data. Afterwards, it is successfully applied to a realistic induction machine model.

A numerical reduced order method that has recently been applied to a wide variety of kinetic partial differential equations is the concept of dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA). In this paper, we consider the thermal radiative transfer equations with Su-Olson closure, leading to a linearized kinetic model. For the conducted theoretical and practical considerations we use a multiplicative splitting of the distribution function that poses additional challenges in finding an energy stable discretization and deriving a hyperbolic Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. We propose such an energy stable DLRA scheme that makes use of the augmented basis update & Galerkin integrator. This integrator allows for additional basis augmentations, enabling us to give a mathematically rigorous proof of energy stability and local mass conservation. Numerical examples confirm the derived properties and show the computational advantages of the DLRA scheme compared to a numerical solution of the full system of equations.

Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we prove formulas for the Fisher--Bures and Kubo--Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.

Spray cooling is a very promising and relatively simple technology to apply, but involves extremely complicated physics. In this paper, a quasi-3D thermal finite-element model of a stator winding is created, by extrusion of a 2D cross-sectional finite-element model along the winding direction. The possible effects of spray cooling are simulated as a heat flux using an impedance boundary condition at the surface of the winding overhang. The results confirm the beneficial performance of spray cooling. The model indicates that spray cooling may allow a ten times larger power density than for standard air- or water-cooled machines.

Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a novel quantum circuit construction that combines classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test, thus overcoming a key obstacle to quantum Boltzmann machine learning that has been left open since [Amin et al., Phys. Rev. X 8, 021050 (2018)]. Additionally supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.

This dependency significantly restricts the scalability and practical applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel framework termed the Mixture of Scale Experts Network (MSENet). MSENet integrates multiple experts trained at different perceptual scales, enabling the capture of scale discrepancies between RGB and thermal image pairs without the need for explicit alignment. Specifically, to address the issue of unaligned scales, MSENet introduces a set of experts designed to perceive the correlation between RGBT image pairs across various scales. These experts are capable of identifying and quantifying the scale differences inherent in the image pairs. Subsequently, a dynamic routing mechanism is incorporated to assign adaptive weights to each expert, allowing the network to dynamically select the most appropriate experts based on the specific characteristics of the input data. Furthermore, to address the issue of weakly unaligned positions, we integrate deformable convolution into the network. Deformable convolution is employed to learn position displacements between the RGB and thermal modalities, thereby mitigating the impact of spatial misalignment. To provide a comprehensive evaluation platform for alignment-free RGBT VOD, we introduce a new benchmark dataset. This dataset includes eleven common object categories, with a total of 60,988 images and 271,835 object instances. The dataset encompasses a wide range of scenes from both daily life and natural environments, ensuring high content diversity and complexity.

However, process variation and thermal fluctuation severely affect the data integrity of STT-MRAM, resulting in both write errors and read errors. Therefore, effective error correction codes (ECCs) are necessary for correcting memory cell errors. Meanwhile, the design of channel quantizer plays a critical role in supporting error correction coding for STT-MRAM. In this work, we propose a union bound analysis which can accurately predict the word error rates (WERs) of ECCs with maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding over the quantized STT-MRAM channel. The derived bound provides a theoretical tool for comparing the performance of ECCs with different quantization schemes at very low error rate levels without resorting to lengthy computer simulations. Moreover, we also propose a new criterion to design the channel quantizer by minimizing the WERs of ECC decoding that are obtained from the union bound analysis. Numerical results show that the proposed union-bound-optimized (UBO) quantizer can achieve better error rate performance than the state-of-art quantizers for STT-MRAM.

However, no existing studies in the building energy systems literature have quantified the economic benefits of data collection strategies to determine whether they are worth their cost. This work demonstrates that Value of Information analysis (VoI), a Bayesian Decision Analysis framework, provides a suitable methodology for quantifying the benefits of data collection. Three example decision problems in building energy systems are studied: air-source heat pump maintenance scheduling, ventilation scheduling for indoor air quality, and ground-source heat pump system design. Smart meters, occupancy monitoring systems, and ground thermal tests are shown to be economically beneficial for supporting these decisions respectively. It is proposed that further study of VoI in building energy systems would allow expenditure on data collection to be economised and prioritised, avoiding wastage.

However, limited reconfigurability, high electrical-optical conversion cost, and thermal sensitivity limit the deployment of current optical analog computing engines to support power-restricted, performance-sensitive AI workloads at scale. Sparsity provides a great opportunity for hardware-efficient AI accelerators. However, current dense photonic accelerators fail to fully exploit the power-saving potential of algorithmic sparsity. It requires sparsity-aware hardware specialization with a fundamental re-design of photonic tensor core topology and cross-layer device-circuit-architecture-algorithm co-optimization aware of hardware non-ideality and power bottleneck. To trim down the redundant power consumption while maximizing robustness to thermal variations, we propose SCATTER, a novel algorithm-circuit co-sparse photonic accelerator featuring dynamically reconfigurable signal path via thermal-tolerant, power-efficient in-situ light redistribution and power gating. A power-optimized, crosstalk-aware dynamic sparse training framework is introduced to explore row-column structured sparsity and ensure marginal accuracy loss and maximum power efficiency. The extensive evaluation shows that our cross-stacked optimized accelerator SCATTER achieves a 511X area reduction and 12.4X power saving with superior crosstalk tolerance that enables unprecedented circuit layout compactness and on-chip power efficiency.

This study navigates through the challenges of data uncertainties, storage limitations, and predictive data-driven modeling using big data. We utilize Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) for effective noise reduction and outlier elimination, and Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) for efficient data compression and storage. The proposed OSP technique enables data compression without substantial information loss while simultaneously reducing storage needs. While RPCA offers an enhanced alternative to traditional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for high-dimensional data management, the scope of this work extends its utilization, focusing on robust, data-driven modeling applicable to huge data sets in real-time. For that purpose, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, are applied to model and predict data based on a low-dimensional subset obtained from OSP, leading to a crucial acceleration of the training phase. LSTMs are feasible for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data, making them particularly suited for predicting the future states of physical systems on historical data. All the presented algorithms are not only theorized but also simulated and validated using real thermal imaging data mapping a ship's engine.

However, 3D technology also presents several drawbacks that prevent its smooth application. Two of the major concerns are heat reduction and power density distribution. In our work, we propose a novel 3D thermal-aware floorplanner that includes: (1) an effective thermal-aware process with 3 different evolutionary algorithms that aim to solve the soft computing problem of optimizing the placement of functional units and through silicon vias, as well as the smooth inclusion of active cooling systems and new design strategies,(2) an approximated thermal model inside the optimization loop, (3) an optimizer for active cooling (liquid channels), and (4) a novel technique based on air channel placement designed to isolate thermal domains have been also proposed. The experimental work is conducted for a realistic many-core single-chip architecture based on the Niagara design. Results show promising improvements of the thermal and reliability metrics, and also show optimal scaling capabilities to target future-trend many-core systems.

Utilizing technologies like thermography can be instrumental in nursing education to assess and enhance these skills. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of thermography in monitoring and improving the emotional skills of nursing students through a case study approach. The case study involved exposing a student to various emotional stimuli, including videos and music, and measuring facial temperature changes. These changes were recorded using a FLIR E6 camera across three phases: acclimatization, stimulus, and response. Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity were also recorded. Distinct thermal responses were observed for different emotions. For instance, during the acclimatization phase with video stimuli, forehead temperatures varied between positive emotions (joy: 34.5\textdegree C to 34.5\textdegree C) and negative emotions (anger: 36.1\textdegree C to 35.1\textdegree C). However, there was a uniform change in temperature during both stimulus (joy: 34.7\textdegree C to 35.0\textdegree C, anger: 35.0\textdegree C to 35.0\textdegree C) and response phases (joy: 35.0\textdegree C to 35.0\textdegree C, anger: 34.8\textdegree C to 35.0\textdegree C). Music stimuli also induced varying thermal patterns (joy: 34.2\textdegree C to 33.9\textdegree C to 33.4\textdegree C, anger: 33.8\textdegree C to 33.4\textdegree C to 33.8\textdegree C).Thermography revealed consistent thermal patterns in response to emotional stimuli, with the exception of the nose area, suggesting its suitability as a non-invasive, quantifiable, and accessible method for emotional skill training in nursing education.

In this direction, many studies are being published on Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems, which help to reduce the preoccupations raised by the independent living of the elderly. In this study, a systematic review of the literature is presented on fall detection and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) for the elderly, as the two main tasks to solve to guarantee the safety of elderly people living alone. To address the current tendency to perform these two tasks, the review focuses on the use of Deep Learning (DL) based approaches on computer vision data. In addition, different collections of data like DL models, datasets or hardware (e.g. depth or thermal cameras) are gathered from the reviewed studies and provided for reference in future studies. Strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches are also discussed and, based on them, our recommendations for future works are provided.

Moreover, the cooling needed to keep the servers within reliable thermal operating conditions also has an impact on the thermal distribution of the data room, thus affecting to servers' power leakage. Optimizing the energy consumption of these infrastructures is a major challenge to place data centers on a more scalable scenario. Thus, understanding the relationship between power, temperature, consolidation and performance is crucial to enable an energy-efficient management at the data center level. In this research, we propose novel power and thermal-aware strategies and models to provide joint cooling and computing optimizations from a local perspective based on the global energy consumption of metaheuristic-based optimizations. Our results show that the combined awareness from both metaheuristic and best fit decreasing algorithms allow us to describe the global energy into faster and lighter optimization strategies that may be used during runtime. This approach allows us to improve the energy efficiency of the data center, considering both computing and cooling infrastructures, in up to a 21.74\% while maintaining quality of service.

Based on the similarity of temperature curves (curve segments of a temperature profile of one point) between any two successive layers, the first stage of the proposed method designs a layer-to-layer prediction model to estimate the temperature curves of the yet-to-print layer from measured temperatures of certain points on the previously printed layer. With measured/predicted temperature profiles of several points on the same layer, the second stage proposes a reduced order model (ROM) (intra-layer prediction model) to decompose and construct the temperature profiles of all points on the same layer, which could be used to build the temperature field of the entire layer. The training of ROM is performed with an extreme learning machine (ELM) for computational efficiency. Fifteen wire arc AM experiments and nine simulations are designed for thin walls with a fixed length and unidirectional printing of each layer. The test results indicate that the proposed prediction method could construct the thermal history of a yet-to-print layer within 0.1 seconds on a low-cost desktop computer. Meanwhile, the method has acceptable generalization capability in most cases from lower layers to higher layers in the same simulation, as well as from one simulation to a new simulation on different AM process parameters. More importantly, after fine-tuning the proposed method with limited experimental data, the relative errors of all predicted temperature profiles on a new experiment are smaller than 0.09, which demonstrates the applicability and generalization of the proposed two-stage thermal history prediction method in online applications for metal AM.

However, the low contrast and lack of chromaticity of TIR images are detrimental to human interpretation and subsequent deployment of RGB-based vision algorithms. Therefore, it makes sense to colorize the nighttime TIR images by translating them into the corresponding daytime color images (NTIR2DC). Despite the impressive progress made in the NTIR2DC task, how to improve the translation performance of small object classes is under-explored. To address this problem, we propose a generative adversarial network incorporating feedback-based object appearance learning (FoalGAN). Specifically, an occlusion-aware mixup module and corresponding appearance consistency loss are proposed to reduce the context dependence of object translation. As a representative example of small objects in nighttime street scenes, we illustrate how to enhance the realism of traffic light by designing a traffic light appearance loss. To further improve the appearance learning of small objects, we devise a dual feedback learning strategy to selectively adjust the learning frequency of different samples. In addition, we provide pixel-level annotation for a subset of the Brno dataset, which can facilitate the research of NTIR image understanding under multiple weather conditions. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed FoalGAN is not only effective for appearance learning of small objects, but also outperforms other image translation methods in terms of semantic preservation and edge consistency for the NTIR2DC task.

However, differing angles from camera capture between thermal and visible sensors has led to misalignment between Visible-Thermal (VT) images. We modernize the classic computer vision task of image registration by applying and modifying a generative alignment algorithm to register VT cancer faces, without the need for a reference or alignment parameters. By registering VT faces, we demonstrate that the quality of thermal images produced in the generative AI downstream task of Visible-to-Thermal (V2T) image translation significantly improves up to 52.5\%, than without registration. Images in this paper have been approved by the NIH NCI for public dissemination.

We cross-reference the thermal anomalies detected by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) hotspot services with the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) database to construct a large-scale hotspot dataset for wildfire-related studies in Europe. Then, we propose a novel multimodal supervised machine learning approach to disambiguate hotspot detections, distinguishing between wildfires and other events. Our methodology includes the use of multimodal data sources, such as the ERSI annual Land Use Land Cover (LULC) and the Copernicus Sentinel-3 data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the task of wildfire identification.

To alleviate this issue, this work introduces a new computer vision task called RGB-thermal (RGBT) VOD by introducing the thermal modality that is insensitive to adverse illumination conditions. To promote the research and development of RGBT VOD, we design a novel Erasure-based Interaction Network (EINet) and establish a comprehensive benchmark dataset (VT-VOD50) for this task. Traditional VOD methods often leverage temporal information by using many auxiliary frames, and thus have large computational burden. Considering that thermal images exhibit less noise than RGB ones, we develop a negative activation function that is used to erase the noise of RGB features with the help of thermal image features. Furthermore, with the benefits from thermal images, we rely only on a small temporal window to model the spatio-temporal information to greatly improve efficiency while maintaining detection accuracy.
  VT-VOD50 dataset consists of 50 pairs of challenging RGBT video sequences with complex backgrounds, various objects and different illuminations, which are collected in real traffic scenarios. Extensive experiments on VT-VOD50 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method against existing mainstream VOD methods. The code of EINet and the dataset will be released to the public for free academic usage.

A strategy to reduce such computational costs is dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), which represents and evolves the solution on a low-rank manifold, thereby significantly decreasing computational and memory requirements. Efficient discretizations for the DLRA evolution equations need to be carefully constructed to guarantee stability while enabling mass conservation. In this work, we focus on the Su-Olson closure leading to a linearized internal energy model and derive a stable discretization through an implicit coupling of internal energy and particle density. Moreover, we propose a rank-adaptive strategy to preserve local mass conservation. Numerical results are presented which showcase the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed low-rank method compared to the solution of the full system.

However, due to a lack of calibration in the lab, photographic capture between two different sensors leads to severely misaligned pairs that can lead to poor results for person re-identification and generative AI. To solve this problem, we introduce our approach for VT image registration called Vista Morph. Unlike existing VT facial registration that requires manual, hand-crafted features for pixel matching and/or a supervised thermal reference, Vista Morph is completely unsupervised without the need for a reference. By learning the affine matrix through a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Spatial Transformer Network (STN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Vista Morph successfully aligns facial and non-facial VT images. Our approach learns warps in Hard, No, and Low-light visual settings and is robust to geometric perturbations and erasure at test time. We conduct a downstream generative AI task to show that registering training data with Vista Morph improves subject identity of generated thermal faces when performing V2T image translation.

The optimal operation of the energy hub exploits its flexibility to increase the energy efficiency and reduce the operational costs. However, uncertainties in the demand present challenges to energy hub optimization. In this paper, we propose a stochastic MPC controller to minimize energy costs using chance constraints for the uncertain electricity and thermal demands. Historical data is used to build a demand prediction model based on Gaussian processes to generate a forecast of the future electricity and heat demands. The stochastic optimization problem is solved via the Scenario Approach by sampling multi-step demand trajectories from the derived prediction model. The performance of the proposed predictor and of the stochastic controller is verified on a simulated energy hub model and demand data from a real building.

However, the addition of a large number of complex cores have also increased the overall power consumption, and power has become a first-order design constraint in modern processors. While we can limit power consumption by simply applying software-based power constraints, applying them blindly will lead to non-trivial performance degradation. To address the challenge of improving the performance, power, and energy efficiency of scientific applications on modern multi-core processors, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network based auto-tuning approach that (i) optimizes runtime performance at pre-defined power constraints, and (ii) simultaneously optimizes for runtime performance and energy efficiency by minimizing the energy-delay product. The key idea behind this approach lies in modeling parallel code regions as flow-aware code graphs to capture both semantic and structural code features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by conducting an extensive evaluation on $30$ benchmarks and proxy-/mini-applications with $68$ OpenMP code regions. Our approach identifies OpenMP configurations at different power constraints that yield a geometric mean performance improvement of more than $25\%$ and $13\%$ over the default OpenMP configuration on a 32-core Skylake and a $16$-core Haswell processor respectively. In addition, when we optimize for the energy-delay product, the OpenMP configurations selected by our auto-tuner demonstrate both performance improvement of $21\%$ and $11\%$ and energy reduction of $29\%$ and $18\%$ over the default OpenMP configuration at Thermal Design Power for the same Skylake and Haswell processors, respectively.

Telemedicine applications could benefit from thermal imagery, but conventional computers are reliant on RGB cameras and lack thermal sensors.

We compare VTF-GAN against several popular GAN baselines and the first conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for VT face translation (VTF-Diff). Results show that VTF-GAN achieves high quality, crisp, and perceptually realistic thermal faces using a combined set of patch, temperature, perceptual, and Fourier Transform losses, compared to all baselines including diffusion.

To extend the load flexibility and thus improve the profitability of green hydrogen production, this paper presents an optimal production scheduling approach for utility-scale P2H plants composed of multiple alkaline electrolyzers. Unlike existing works, this work discards the conservative constant steady-state constraints and first leverages the dynamic thermal and hydrogen-to-oxygen (HTO) impurity crossover processes of electrolyzers. Doing this optimizes their effects on the loading range and energy conversion efficiency, therefore improving the load flexibility of P2H production. The proposed multiphysics-aware scheduling model is formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). It coordinates the electrolyzers' operation state transitions and load allocation subject to comprehensive thermodynamic and mass transfer constraints. A decomposition-based solution method, SDM-GS-ALM, is followingly adopted to address the scalability issue for scheduling large-scale P2H plants composed of tens of electrolyzers. With an experiment-verified dynamic electrolyzer model, case studies up to 22 electrolyzers show that the proposed method remarkably improves the hydrogen output and profit of P2H production powered by either solar or wind energy compared to the existing scheduling approach.

Using the SpeakingFace and Thermal-Mask dataset, we propose a process to assess fairness on real images and show how the same process can be applied to synthetic images. The resulting process shows a demographic parity difference of 1.59 for random guessing and increases to 5.0 when the recognition performance increases to a precision and recall rate of 99.99\%. We indicate that inherently biased datasets can deeply impact the fairness of any biometric system. A primary cause of a biased dataset is the class imbalance due to the data collection process. To address imbalanced datasets, the classes with fewer samples can be augmented with synthetic images to generate a more balanced dataset resulting in less bias when training a machine learning system. For biometric-enabled systems, fairness is of critical importance, while the related concept of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) is well suited for the generalization of fairness in biometrics, in this paper, we focus on the 3 most common demographic groups age, gender, and ethnicity.

Additionally, we demonstrated the dataset's utility for simulating heat mitigation strategies and building energy consumption using WRF-Urban, with test cases in Chicago, IL, and Austin, TX. Street-scale mean radiant temperature simulations using the Solar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry (SOLWEIG) model, incorporating UT-GLOBUS and LiDAR-derived building heights, confirmed the dataset's effectiveness in modeling human thermal comfort in Baltimore, MD (daytime RMSE = 2.85 C). Thus, UT-GLOBUS can be used for modeling urban hazards with significant socioeconomic and biometeorological risks, enabling finer scale urban climate simulations and overcoming previous limitations due to the lack of building information.

The main contribution of this work is the application of the complete workflow to a real-life industrial model of an elastoviscoplastic high-pressure turbine blade subjected to thermal, centrifugal and pressure loadings, for the quantification of the uncertainty on dual quantities (such as the accumulated plastic strain and the stress tensor), generated by the uncertainty on the temperature loading field. The dictionary-based ROM-net computes predictions of dual quantities of interest for 1008 Monte Carlo draws of the temperature loading field in 2 hours and 48 minutes, which corresponds to a speedup greater than 600 with respect to a reference parallel solver using domain decomposition, with a relative error in the order of 2%. Another contribution of this work consists in the derivation of a meta-model to reconstruct the dual quantities of interest over the complete mesh from their values on the reduced integration points.

Providing a method to generate thermal faces from visible images would be highly valuable for the telemedicine community in order to show this medical information. To the best of our knowledge, there are limited works on visible-to-thermal (VT) face translation, and many current works go the opposite direction to generate visible faces from thermal surveillance images (TV) for law enforcement applications. As a result, we introduce favtGAN, a VT GAN which uses the pix2pix image translation model with an auxiliary sensor label prediction network for generating thermal faces from visible images. Since most TV methods are trained on only one data source drawn from one thermal sensor, we combine datasets from faces and cityscapes. These combined data are captured from similar sensors in order to bootstrap the training and transfer learning task, especially valuable because visible-thermal face datasets are limited. Experiments on these combined datasets show that favtGAN demonstrates an increase in SSIM and PSNR scores of generated thermal faces, compared to training on a single face dataset alone.

Thermal physiology research has been ongoing since the late nineties. This research lies at the intersections of medicine, psychology, machine learning, optics, and affective computing. We will review the known factors of thermal vs. RGB imaging for facial emotion recognition. But we also propose that thermal imagery may provide a semi-anonymous modality for computer vision, over RGB, which has been plagued by misuse in facial recognition. However, the transition to adopting thermal imagery as a source for any human-centered AI task is not easy and relies on the availability of high fidelity data sources across multiple demographics and thorough validation. This paper takes the reader on a short review of machine learning in thermal FER and the limitations of collecting and developing thermal FER data for AI training. Our motivation is to provide an introductory overview into recent advances for thermal FER and stimulate conversation about the limitations in current datasets.

Improving their performance is crucial for developing the next-generation efficient and cost effective devices. Topology optimization (TO) has emerged as a powerful computational tool to design LHTES systems by optimally distributing a high-conductivity material (HCM) and a phase change material (PCM). However, conventional TO typically limits to optimizing the geometry for a fixed, pre-selected materials. This approach does not leverage the large and expanding databases of novel materials. Consequently, the co-design of material and geometry for LHTES remains a challenge and unexplored. To address this limitation, we present an automated design framework for the concurrent optimization of material choice and topology. A key challenge is the discrete nature of material selection, which is incompatible with the gradient-based methods used for TO. We overcome this by using a data-driven variational autoencoder (VAE) to project discrete material databases for both the HCM and PCM onto continuous and differentiable latent spaces. These continuous material representations are integrated into an end-to-end differentiable, transient nonlinear finite-element solver that accounts for phase change. We demonstrate this framework on a problem aimed at maximizing the discharged energy within a specified time, subject to cost constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through several illustrative examples.

This paper presents the DISTANT (Distant Transmission and Steering Systems) design, a novel approach for relocating rover traction and steering actuators from wheel-mounted positions to a thermally protected warm box within the rover body. The design addresses critical challenges in long-distance traversal missions by protecting sensitive components from thermal cycling, dust contamination, and mechanical wear. A double wishbone suspension configuration with cardan joints and capstan drive steering has been selected as the optimal architecture following comprehensive trade-off analysis. The system enables independent wheel traction, steering control, and suspension management whilst maintaining all motorisation within the protected environment. The design meets a 50 km traverse requirement without performance degradation, with integrated dust protection mechanisms and thermal management solutions. Testing and validation activities are planned for Q1 2026 following breadboard manufacturing at 1:3 scale.

To enhance performance, the Segment Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high- and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

While deep learning models excel at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise. Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.

However, deploying these models on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi poses challenges related to computational efficiency and thermal management. In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for audio tagging on the Raspberry Pi is conducted, encompassing all 1D and 2D models from the Pretrained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) framework, a ConvNeXt-based model adapted for audio classification, as well as MobileNetV3 architectures. In addition, two PANNs-derived networks, CNN9 and CNN13, recently proposed, are also evaluated. To enhance deployment efficiency and portability across diverse hardware platforms, all models are converted to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. Unlike previous works that focus on a single model, our analysis encompasses a broader range of architectures and involves continuous 24-hour inference sessions to assess performance stability. Our experiments reveal that, with appropriate model selection and optimization, it is possible to maintain consistent inference latency and manage thermal behavior effectively over extended periods. These findings provide valuable insights for deploying audio tagging models in real-world edge computing scenarios.

While traditional thermal analyses often employ uniform power maps to simplify computational complexity, this practice neglects localized heating effects, leading to inaccuracies in thermal estimations, especially when comparing power delivery networks (PDN) in 3D integration. This work examines the thermal impact of non-uniform power distributions on SiPs utilizing frontside (FSPDN) and backside (BSPDN) power delivery approaches. Using high-resolution thermal simulations with non-uniform power maps at resolutions down to 5 micrometers, we demonstrate that uniform power assumptions substantially underestimate peak temperatures and fail to reveal critical thermal differences between BSPDN and FSPDN configurations in 3D scenarios. Our results highlight that BSPDN configurations in 3D, although beneficial in simplified uniform scenarios, exhibit pronounced thermal penalties under realistic, localized workloads due to limited lateral heat spreading. These findings emphasize the necessity of adopting fine-grained, workload-aware power maps in early-stage thermal modeling to enable accurate PDN assessment and informed thermal-aware design decisions in advanced nanosheet-based 3D SiP.

A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.

To support reliable prediction of this quantity, several empirical correlations and lookup tables have been constructed from physical experiments over the past several decades. With the onset of accessible machine learning (ML) frameworks, multiple initiatives have been established with the goal of predicting CHF more accurately than these traditional methods. While purely data-driven surrogate modeling has been extensively investigated, these approaches lack interpretability, lack resilience to data scarcity, and have been developed mostly using data from tube experiments. As a result, bias-correction hybrid approaches have become increasingly popular, which correct initial "low-fidelity" estimates provided by deterministic base models by using ML-predicted residuals. This body of work has mostly considered round tube geometries; annular geometry-specific ML models have not yet been deployed in thermal hydraulic codes. This study developed, deployed, and validated four ML models to predict CHF in annular geometries using the CTF subchannel code. Three empirical correlation models, Biasi, Bowring, and Katto, were used as base models for comparison. The ML models were trained and tested using 577 experimental annulus data points from four datasets: Becker, Beus, Janssen, and Mortimore. Baseline CHF predictions were obtained from the empirical correlations, with mean relative errors above 26%. The ML-driven models achieved mean relative errors below 3.5%, with no more than one point exceeding the 10% error envelope. In all cases, the hybrid ML models significantly outperformed their empirical counterparts.

The situation becomes more complicated when such attacks are more evasive and operate sporadically to stay hidden from detection mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce Intermittent Thermal Trojans (iThermTroj) that exploit the chips' thermal information in a random time-triggered manner. According to our experiments, iThermTroj attack can easily bypass available threshold-based thermal Trojan detection solutions. We investigate SoC vulnerabilities to variations of iThermTroj through an in-depth analysis of Trojan activation and duration scenarios. We also propose a set of tiny Machine Learning classifiers for run-time anomaly detection to protect SoCs against such intermittent thermal Trojan attacks. Compared to existing methods, our approach improves the attack detection rate by 29.4\%, 17.2\%, and 14.3\% in scenarios where iThermTroj manipulates up to 80\%, 60\%, and 40\% of SoC's thermal data, respectively. Additionally, our method increases the full protection resolution to 0.8 degrees Celsius, meaning that any temperature manipulations exceeding $\pm 0.8$ degrees will be detected with 100\% accuracy.

This complexity arises from the non-linear, time-dependent interactions among all the variables of the control problem and the changing internal and external constraints. Focusing on the accurate modeling of the indoor temperature, we propose a data-driven approach to address this challenge. We account for thermal inertia, non-linear effects, small perturbations of the indoor climate dynamics caused by ventilation and weather variations, as well as for the stochastic nature of the control system due to the observed noise in the input signal. Since the prohibitive cost of quality data acquisition and processing limits the implementation of data-driven approaches for real-life problems, we applied a method that merges several Bayesian machine learning and deep learning architectures that are suitable for predicting complex system dynamics, while relaxing the dataset quality requirements. Our framework includes a built-in deep Kalman filter, which makes it deployable even with low-accuracy temperature sensors. It achieves state-of-the-art performance, best performing with a 150-minute prediction horizon with an RMSE of 0.2455, an MAE of 0.162, and an $R^2$ of 0.926. The model's performance remains consistent even when exposed to highly noisy data. Finally, we show how our approach can be extended to other applications including demand response event duration prediction and equipment failure detection.

However, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting downstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization methods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information and insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image distortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery provides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details and enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral information to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework employs a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as the generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention computation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral attention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and reducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a Transformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped architecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale wavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency dual domain. Multiple STformer modules are cascaded to form MTSIC, progressively optimizing the reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional techniques and effectively enhances the visual quality of infrared images.

Accurate CHF prediction is essential for efficiency, safety, and preventing equipment damage, particularly in nuclear reactors. Although widely used, empirical correlations frequently exhibit discrepancies in comparison with experimental data, limiting their reliability in diverse operational conditions. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated the potential for CHF prediction but have often suffered from limited interpretability, data scarcity, and insufficient knowledge of physical principles. Hybrid model approaches, which combine data-driven ML with physics-based models, mitigate these concerns by incorporating prior knowledge of the domain. This study integrated a purely data-driven ML model and two hybrid models (using the Biasi and Bowring CHF correlations) within the CTF subchannel code via a custom Fortran framework. Performance was evaluated using two validation cases: a subset of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission CHF database and the Bennett dryout experiments. In both cases, the hybrid models exhibited significantly lower error metrics in comparison with conventional empirical correlations. The pure ML model remained competitive with the hybrid models. Trend analysis of error parity indicates that ML-based models reduce the tendency for CHF overprediction, improving overall accuracy. These results demonstrate that ML-based CHF models can be effectively integrated into subchannel codes and can potentially increase performance in comparison with conventional methods.

However, the thermal placement of chiplet, due to the high complexity of thermal simulation, is very challenging. In this paper, a surrogate-assisted simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to simultaneously minimize both the wirelength and the maximum temperature of integrated chips. To alleviate the computational cost of thermal simulation, a radial basis function network is introduced to approximate the thermal field, assisted by which the simulated annealing algorithm converges to the better placement in less time. Numerical results demonstrate that the surrogate-assisted simulated annealing algorithm is competitive to the state-of-the-art thermal placement algorithms of chiplet, suggesting its potential application in the agile design of 2.5D package chip.

By exploiting the amplifying capability of active RISs, noticeable performance improvement can be expected when precise channel state information (CSI) is available. Since obtaining perfect CSI related to an RIS is difficult in practice, a robust transmission design is proposed in this paper to tackle the channel uncertainty issue, which will be more severe for active RIS-aided systems. To account for the worst-case scenario, the minimum achievable rate of each user is derived under a statistical CSI error model. Subsequently, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum of the minimum achievable rate. Since the objective function is non-concave, the formulated problem is transformed into a tractable lower bound maximization problem, which is solved using an alternating optimization method. Numerical results show that the proposed robust design outperforms a baseline scheme that only exploits estimated CSI.

Conventional current and voltage measurements, however, have inherent limitations in fully inferring the multiphysics-resolved dynamics inside battery cells. This creates an accuracy barrier that constrains battery usage and reduces cost-competitiveness and sustainability across industries dependent on battery technology. In this work, we introduce an integrated sensor framework that combines novel mechanical, thermal, gas, optical, and electrical sensors with traditional measurements to break through this barrier. We generate three unique datasets with eleven measurement types and propose an explainable machine-learning approach for SOC estimation. This approach renders the measured signals and the predictive result of machine learning physically interpretable with respect to battery SOC, offering fundamental insights into the time-varying importance of different signals. Our experimental results reveal a marked increase in SOC estimation accuracy--enhanced from 46.1% to 74.5%--compared to conventional methods. This approach not only advances SOC monitoring precision but also establishes a foundation for monitoring additional battery states to further improve safety, extend lifespan, and facilitate fast charging.

On this background, digital twins of cities become paramount in advancing urban energy system planning and infrastructure management. The use of recorded energy data from sensors in district digital twins in collaborative co-simulation platforms is a promising way to analyze detailed system behavior and estimate future scenarios. However, the development and coupling of multi-physics energy system models need to be validated before they can be used for further in-depth analyses. In the present paper, a new multi-physics/-modal and highly configurable building model is presented. Its accuracy and reliability are validated by comparison with data from the TABULA project, ensuring its relevance and applicability to real-world scenarios. The modularity and flexibility with regard to the system configurability of the developed building model is evaluated on various real building types. In addition, the applicability of the building model in a multi-energy system is highlighted by implementing the model in a collaborative co-simulation setup and by coupling it to a district heating grid model in yearly co-simulations. The simulation results for the proposed multi-physical/-modal building modeling concept show a very high level of agreement compared to published reference building data and can therefore be used individually as flexible and modular building models including both thermal and electrical systems for future sector-coupled energy system analyses in view of sustainability.

Traditional catalyst evaluation methods primarily rely on machine learning techniques; however, these methods often struggle to process multi-source heterogeneous data, limiting both predictive accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Embedding-Attention-Permutated CNN-Residual (EAPCR) deep learning model. EAPCR constructs a feature association matrix using embedding and attention mechanisms and enhances predictive performance through permutated CNN architectures and residual connections. This approach enables the model to accurately capture complex feature interactions across various catalytic conditions, leading to precise efficiency predictions. EAPCR serves as a powerful tool for computational researchers while also assisting domain experts in optimizing catalyst design, effectively bridging the gap between data-driven modeling and experimental applications. We evaluate EAPCR on datasets from TiO2 photocatalysis, thermal catalysis, and electrocatalysis, demonstrating its superiority over traditional machine learning methods (e.g., linear regression, random forest) as well as conventional deep learning models (e.g., ANN, NNs). Across multiple evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R2, and RMSE), EAPCR consistently outperforms existing approaches. These findings highlight the strong potential of EAPCR in inorganic catalytic efficiency prediction. As a versatile deep learning framework, EAPCR not only improves predictive accuracy but also establishes a solid foundation for future large-scale model development in inorganic catalysis.

Accurate Time of Birth (ToB) documentation is essential for optimizing neonatal care, as timely interventions are vital for proper resuscitation. However, current clinical methods for recording ToB often rely on manual processes, which can be prone to inaccuracies. In this study, we present a novel two-stream fusion system that combines the power of image and video analysis to accurately detect the ToB from thermal recordings in the delivery room and operating theater. By integrating static and dynamic streams, our approach captures richer birth-related spatiotemporal features, leading to more robust and precise ToB estimation. We demonstrate that this synergy between data modalities enhances performance over single-stream approaches. Our system achieves 95.7% precision and 84.8% recall in detecting birth within short video clips. Additionally, with the help of a score aggregation module, it successfully identifies ToB in 100% of test cases, with a median absolute error of 2 seconds and an absolute mean deviation of 4.5 seconds compared to manual annotations.

With many approaches reaching maturity, the next phase of investigation will determine the feasibility and usefulness of ML model implementation in a production setting. Several of the codes used for reactor design and assessment are primarily written in the Fortran language, which is not immediately compatible with TensorFlow-trained ML models. This study presents a framework for implementing deep neural networks (DNNs) and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) in Fortran, allowing for native execution without TensorFlow's C API, Python runtime, or ONNX conversion. Designed for ease of use and computational efficiency, the framework can be implemented in any Fortran code, supporting iterative solvers and UQ via ensembles or BNNs. Verification was performed using a two-input, one-output test case composed of a noisy sinusoid to compare Fortran-based predictions to those from TensorFlow. The DNN predictions showed negligible differences and achieved a 19.6x speedup, whereas the BNN predictions exhibited minor disagreement, plausibly due to differences in random number generation. An 8.0x speedup was noted for BNN inference. The approach was then further verified on a nuclear-relevant problem predicting critical heat flux (CHF), which demonstrated similar behavior along with significant computational gains. Discussion regarding the framework's successful integration into the CTF thermal-hydraulics code is also included, outlining its practical usefulness. Overall, this framework was shown to be effective at implementing both DNN and BNN model inference within Fortran, allowing for the continued study of ML-based methods in real-world nuclear applications.

Some accelerator magnets use cables whose electric insulation is significantly thinner than the bare electric conductor. The FE discretisation of such geometries with high-quality meshes leads to many degrees of freedom. This increases the computational time, particularly since non-linear material properties are involved. In this work, we propose to use a thermal thin-shell approximation (TSA) to improve the computational efficiency when solving the heat diffusion equation in two dimensions. We apply the method to compute the thermal transient response of superconducting accelerator magnets used for CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC. The TSA collapses thin electrical insulation layers into lines while accurately representing the thermal gradient across the insulation's thickness. The TSA is implemented in the multipole module of the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS), which can generate the multipole magnet models programmatically from input text files. First, the TSA approach is verified by comparison to classical FE simulations with meshed surface insulation regions for a simple block of four cables and a detailed model of the MBH dipole. The results show that the TSA approach reduces the computational time significantly while preserving the accuracy of the solution. Second, the quench heater (QH) delay computed with the TSA method is compared to measurements for the MBH magnet. To this end, the thermal transient simulation is coupled to a magnetostatic solution to account for magneto-resistive effects. Third, the TSA's full capabilities are showcased in non-linear magneto-thermal simulations of several LHC and HL-LHC superconducting magnet models. The full source code, including all input files, is publicly available.

The method employs Wachspress rational basis functions to construct conforming interpolations over arbitrary convex polygonal meshes, providing enhanced geometric flexibility and accuracy in capturing complex boundary conditions and heterogeneous material behavior. A quadtree-based acceleration strategy is introduced to significantly reduce computational cost through the reuse of precomputed stiffness and mass matrices. The PFEM is implemented in ABAQUS via a user-defined element (UEL) framework. Comprehensive benchmark problems, including multi-scale and non-matching mesh scenarios, are conducted to verify the accuracy, convergence properties, and computational efficiency of the method. Results indicate that the proposed PFEM offers notable advantages over conventional FEM in terms of mesh adaptability, solution quality, and runtime performance. The method shows strong potential for large-scale simulations involving thermal-mechanical coupling, complex geometries, and multi-resolution modeling.

Currently, most of the side-channel attack methods train a model for each individual byte, without considering the correlation between bytes. However, since the models' parameters for attacking different bytes may be similar, we can leverage transfer learning, meaning that we first train the model for one of the key bytes, then use the trained model as a pretrained model for the remaining bytes. This technique can be applied iteratively, a process known as iterative transfer learning. Experimental results show that when using thermal or power consumption map images as input, and multilayer perceptron or convolutional neural network as the model, our method improves average performance, especially when the amount of data is insufficient.

This research introduces a new attack method called the Multi-stage Adaptive Thermal Trojan for Efficiency and Resilience Degradation (MATTER). MATTER takes advantage of weaknesses in Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) systems by manipulating temperature sensor interfaces, which leads to incorrect thermal sensing and disrupts the SoC's ability to manage heat effectively. Our experiments show that this attack can degrade DTM performance by as much as 73%, highlighting serious vulnerabilities in modern mobile devices. By exploiting the trust placed in temperature sensors, MATTER causes DTM systems to make poor decisions i.e., failing to activate cooling when needed. This not only affects how well the system works but also threatens the lifespan of the hardware. This paper provides a thorough analysis of how MATTER works and emphasizes the need for stronger thermal management systems in SoCs.

The copper terminals are used for current injection and conduction cooling. An inherent variation of the critical current along the CC length results from its manufacturing process. This variation causes non-uniform heat generation, particularly when the coil is operated at a high fraction of the nominal critical current or when large critical current defects are present. The temperature distribution resulting from the balance between cooling and heating, in combination with the magnetic field and critical current distributions, determines whether a thermal runaway occurs. Accurately predicting the level of critical current defects that can be tolerated during conduction-cooled operation is difficult and requires a 3D coupled electromagnetic and thermal simulation. This paper presents the results of simulations that are performed with the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS) tool developed at CERN as part of the STEAM framework. The 3D coupled magnetodynamic-thermal simulations are based on the H-phi formulation and use thin shell approximations, a CC homogenization and conduction-cooling. The critical current (Ic) is varied along the CC length. The effect of a single defect specified as a reduction of Ic along the CC length is investigated in terms of the coil's ability to reach and maintain the operating conditions. The Ic and length of the defect that results in a thermal runaway are analyzed in terms of defect location. In addition, a classical 1D scenario with a quench heater is studied. Both the local defect and the heater cases are compared in terms of the voltage signal available for quench detection. These cases result in very different requirements for quench detection, and their implications are discussed.

However, a significant challenge arises due to the misalignment between these modalities, particularly under real-world conditions where data often appear heavily misaligned. Conventional methods developed on well-aligned or minimally misaligned datasets fail to address these discrepancies adequately. This paper introduces a new framework for multispectral pedestrian detection designed specifically to handle heavily misaligned datasets without the need for costly and complex traditional pre-processing calibration. By leveraging Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLM) for cross-modal semantic alignment, our approach seeks to enhance detection accuracy by aligning semantic information across the RGB and thermal domains. This method not only simplifies the operational requirements but also extends the practical usability of multispectral detection technologies in practical applications.

Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based research, objective data collection, and opportunities for learning from real newborn resuscitation emergency events. Generating and evaluating automated newborn resuscitation algorithm activity timelines relative to the Time of Birth (ToB) offers a promising opportunity to enhance newborn care practices. Given the importance of prompt resuscitation interventions within the "golden minute" after birth, having an accurate ToB with second precision is essential for effective subsequent analysis of newborn resuscitation episodes. Instead, ToB is generally registered manually, often with minute precision, making the process inefficient and susceptible to error and imprecision. In this work, we explore the fusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and thermal imaging to develop the first AI-driven ToB detector. The use of temperature information offers a promising alternative to detect the newborn while respecting the privacy of healthcare providers and mothers. However, the frequent inconsistencies in thermal measurements, especially in a multi-camera setup, make normalization strategies critical. Our methodology involves a three-step process: first, we propose an adaptive normalization method based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to mitigate issues related to temperature variations; second, we implement and deploy an AI model to detect the presence of the newborn within the thermal video frames; and third, we evaluate and post-process the model's predictions to estimate the ToB. A precision of 88.1\% and a recall of 89.3\% are reported in the detection of the newborn within thermal frames during performance evaluation. Our approach achieves an absolute median deviation of 2.7 seconds in estimating the ToB relative to the manual annotations.

Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.

The design of the bandwidth and angular range of the nonreciprocal effect, which directly affects the performance of nonreciprocal emitters, typically relies on physical intuition. In this study, we present a general numerical approach to maximize the nonreciprocal effect. We choose doped magneto-optic materials and magnetic Weyl semimetal materials as model materials and focus on pattern-free multilayer structures. The optimization randomly starts from a less effective structure and incrementally improves the broadband nonreciprocity through the combination of Bayesian optimization and reparameterization. Optimization results show that the proposed approach can discover structures that can achieve broadband nonreciprocal emission at wavelengths from 5 to 40 micrometers using only a fewer layers, significantly outperforming current state-of-the-art designs based on intuition in terms of both performance and simplicity.

This work presents a new modelling approach for battery cells of different shapes by integrating Chebyshev spectral-Galerkin method and model component decomposition. As a result, a library of reduced-order computationally efficient battery thermal models is obtained, characterised by different numbers of states. These models are validated against a high-fidelity finite element model and are compared with a thermal equivalent circuit (TEC) model under real-world vehicle driving and battery cooling scenarios. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed model with four states can faithfully capture the two-dimensional thermal dynamics, while the model with only one state significantly outperforms the widely-used two-state TEC model in both accuracy and computational efficiency, reducing computation time by 28.7%. Furthermore, our developed models allow for independent control of tab and surface cooling channels, enabling effective thermal performance optimisation. Additionally, the proposed model's versatility and effectiveness are demonstrated through various applications, including the evaluation of different cooling scenarios, closed-loop temperature control, and cell design optimisation.

NBTU utilizes a high-frequency alternating electric field to excite a piezoelectric transducer, generating acoustic waves that cause localized heating and tumor cell ablation, and it provides a more precise ablation by delivering lower acoustic power doses directly to targeted tumors while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. Building on our previous work, this study introduces a database for optimizing pre-operative surgical planning by simulating ablation effects in varied tissue environments and develops an extended simulation model incorporating various tumor types and sizes to evaluate thermal damage under trans-tissue conditions. A comprehensive database is created from these simulations, detailing critical parameters such as CEM43 isodose maps, temperature changes, thermal dose areas, and maximum ablation distances for four directional probes. This database serves as a valuable resource for future studies, aiding in complex trajectory planning and parameter optimization for NBTU procedures. Moreover, a novel probe selection method is proposed to enhance pre-surgical planning, providing a strategic approach to selecting probes that maximize therapeutic efficiency and minimize ablation time. By avoiding unnecessary thermal propagation and optimizing probe angles, this method has the potential to improve patient outcomes and streamline surgical procedures. Overall, the findings of this study contribute significantly to the field of NBTU, offering a robust framework for enhancing treatment precision and efficacy in clinical settings.

This technique is suitable for both primary and metastatic cancers, utilizing a high-frequency alternating electric field (up to 10 MHz) to excite a piezoelectric transducer. The resulting rapid deformation of the transducer produces an acoustic wave that propagates through tissue, leading to localized high-temperature heating at the target tumor site and inducing rapid cell death. To optimize the design of NBTU transducers for thermal dose delivery during treatment, numerical modeling of the acoustic pressure field generated by the deforming piezoelectric transducer is frequently employed. The bioheat transfer process generated by the input pressure field is used to track the thermal propagation of the applicator over time. Magnetic resonance thermal imaging (MRTI) can be used to experimentally validate these models. Validation results using MRTI demonstrated the feasibility of this model, showing a consistent thermal propagation pattern. However, a thermal damage isodose map is more advantageous for evaluating therapeutic efficacy. To achieve a more accurate simulation based on the actual brain tissue environment, a new finite element method (FEM) simulation with enhanced damage evaluation capabilities was conducted. The results showed that the highest temperature and ablated volume differed between experimental and simulation results by 2.1884Â°C (3.71%) and 0.0631 cm$^3$ (5.74%), respectively. The lowest Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for peak temperature was 0.7117, and the lowest Dice coefficient for the ablated area was 0.7021, indicating a good agreement in accuracy between simulation and experiment.

Approximate computing is a novel computing paradigm that produces imprecise results by relaxing the need for fully precise output for error-tolerant applications including multimedia, data mining, and image processing. We investigate how approximate computing can improve the noise resilience of quantum adder circuits in NISQ quantum computing. We propose five designs of approximate quantum adders to reduce depth while making them noise-resilient, in which three designs are with carryout, while two are without carryout. We have used novel design approaches that include approximating the Sum only from the inputs (pass-through designs) and having zero depth, as they need no quantum gates. The second design style uses a single CNOT gate to approximate the SUM with a constant depth of O(1). We performed our experimentation on IBM Qiskit on noise models including thermal, depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase damping, and bitflip: (i) Compared to exact quantum ripple carry adder without carryout the proposed approximate adders without carryout have improved fidelity ranging from 8.34% to 219.22%, and (ii) Compared to exact quantum ripple carry adder with carryout the proposed approximate adders with carryout have improved fidelity ranging from 8.23% to 371%. Further, the proposed approximate quantum adders are evaluated in terms of various error metrics.

However, reconstructing thermal scenes in 3D presents several challenges due to the comparatively lower resolution and limited features present in long-wave infrared (LWIR) images. To overcome these challenges, we propose a unified framework for scene reconstruction from a set of LWIR and RGB images, using a multispectral radiance field to represent a scene viewed by both visible and infrared cameras, thus leveraging information across both spectra. We calibrate the RGB and infrared cameras with respect to each other, as a preprocessing step using a simple calibration target. We demonstrate our method on real-world sets of RGB and LWIR photographs captured from a handheld thermal camera, showing the effectiveness of our method at scene representation across the visible and infrared spectra. We show that our method is capable of thermal super-resolution, as well as visually removing obstacles to reveal objects that are occluded in either the RGB or thermal channels.

Electric and autonomous vehicles are a prominent application field. Thermal Interface Materials are used to transfer heat from a semiconductor to a heatsink. They are applied along a dispense path onto the semiconductor and spread over its entire surface once the heatsink is joined. To plan this application path, design engineers typically perform an iterative trial-and-error procedure of elaborate simulations and manual experiments. We propose a fully automated optimization approach, which clearly outperforms the current manual path planning and respects all relevant manufacturing constraints. An optimum dispense path increases the reliability of the thermal interface and makes the manufacturing more sustainable by reducing material waste. We show results on multiple real products from automotive series production, including an experimental validation on actual series manufacturing equipment.

Derivatives can be evaluated at arbitrary points, without performing a global solve or constructing a volumetric grid or mesh. The method is hence well suited to inverse problems with complex geometry, such as PDE-constrained shape optimization. Like other walk on spheres (WoS) algorithms, our method is trivial to parallelize, and is agnostic to boundary representation (meshes, splines, implicit surfaces, etc.), supporting large topological changes. We focus in particular on screened Poisson equations, which model diverse problems from scientific and geometric computing. As in differentiable rendering, we jointly estimate derivatives with respect to all parameters -- hence, cost does not grow significantly with parameter count. In practice, even noisy derivative estimates exhibit fast, stable convergence for stochastic gradient-based optimization, as we show through examples from thermal design, shape from diffusion, and computer graphics.

To address these issues, in this paper, we utilize a novel multi-functional RIS (MF-RIS) to enhance the secrecy performance of wireless users, and investigate the physical layer secrecy problem in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. Specifically, we derive the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and secrecy throughput expressions of users in MF-RIS-assisted NOMA networks with external and internal eavesdroppers. The asymptotic expressions for SOP and secrecy diversity order are also analyzed under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additionally, we examine the impact of receiver hardware limitations and error transmission-induced imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the secrecy performance. Numerical results indicate that: i) under the same power budget, the secrecy performance achieved by MF-RIS significantly outperforms active RIS and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS; ii) with increasing power budget, residual interference caused by imperfect SIC surpasses thermal noise as the primary factor affecting secrecy capacity; and iii) deploying additional elements at the MF-RIS brings significant secrecy enhancements for the external eavesdropping scenario, in contrast to the internal eavesdropping case.

However, the quality of the depth and thermal images is often unreliable in some challenging scenarios, which will result in the performance degradation of the two-modal based salient object detection (SOD). Meanwhile, some researchers pay attention to the triple-modal SOD task, where they attempt to explore the complementarity of the RGB image, the depth image, and the thermal image. However, existing triple-modal SOD methods fail to perceive the quality of depth maps and thermal images, which leads to performance degradation when dealing with scenes with low-quality depth and thermal images. Therefore, we propose a quality-aware selective fusion network (QSF-Net) to conduct VDT salient object detection, which contains three subnets including the initial feature extraction subnet, the quality-aware region selection subnet, and the region-guided selective fusion subnet. Firstly, except for extracting features, the initial feature extraction subnet can generate a preliminary prediction map from each modality via a shrinkage pyramid architecture. Then, we design the weakly-supervised quality-aware region selection subnet to generate the quality-aware maps. Concretely, we first find the high-quality and low-quality regions by using the preliminary predictions, which further constitute the pseudo label that can be used to train this subnet. Finally, the region-guided selective fusion subnet purifies the initial features under the guidance of the quality-aware maps, and then fuses the triple-modal features and refines the edge details of prediction maps through the intra-modality and inter-modality attention (IIA) module and the edge refinement (ER) module, respectively. Extensive experiments are performed on VDT-2048

Maximizing the throughput for multi-programmed workloads on such systems is indispensable as one single program typically cannot fully exploit all available resources. At the same time, power consumption is a key issue and often requires optimizing power allocations to the CPU and GPU while enforcing a total power constraint, in particular when the power/thermal requirements are strict. The result is a system-wide optimization problem with several knobs. In particular we focus on (1) co-scheduling decisions, i.e., selecting programs to co-locate in a space sharing manner; (2) resource partitioning on both CPUs and GPUs; and (3) power capping on both CPUs and GPUs. We solve this problem using predictive performance modeling using machine learning in order to coordinately optimize the above knob setups. Our experiential results using a real system show that our approach achieves up to 67% of speedup compared to a time-sharing-based scheduling with a naive power capping that evenly distributes power budgets across components.

Owing to its capability to amplify the incident signals, active RIS can mitigate the multiplicative fading effect inherent in the passive RIS-aided system. In this paper, we consider an active RIS-aided uplink multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in the presence of phase noise at the active RIS. Specifically, we employ a two-timescale scheme, where the beamforming at the base station (BS) is adjusted based on the instantaneous aggregated channel state information (CSI) and the statistical CSI serves as the basis for designing the phase shifts at the active RIS, so that the feedback overhead and computational complexity can be significantly reduced. The aggregated channel composed of the cascaded and direct channels is estimated by utilizing the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) technique. Based on the estimated channel, we derive the analytical closed-form expression of a lower bound of the achievable rate. The power scaling laws in the active RIS-aided system are investigated based on the theoretical expressions. When the transmit power of each user is scaled down by the number of BS antennas M or reflecting elements N, we find that the thermal noise will cause the lower bound of the achievable rate to approach zero, as the number of M or N increases to infinity. Moreover, an optimization approach based on genetic algorithms (GA) is introduced to tackle the phase shift optimization problem. Numerical results reveal that the active RIS can greatly enhance the performance of the considered system under various settings.

The mortar TSA method's formulation is derived and enables an independent discretization of the subdomains on the two sides of the TSA depending on their accuracy requirements. The method is verified by comparison with a reference FE solution of a thermal model problem of a simplified superconducting accelerator magnet.

Many of these structures are Voronoi-like; therefore researchers have proposed Voronoi multi-scale designs for a wide variety of engineering applications. However, designing such structures can be computationally prohibitive due to the multi-scale nature of the underlying analysis and optimization. In this work, we propose the use of a neural network (NN) to carry out efficient topology optimization (TO) of multi-scale Voronoi structures. The NN is first trained using Voronoi parameters (cell site locations, thickness, orientation, and anisotropy) to predict the homogenized constitutive properties. This network is then integrated into a conventional TO framework to minimize structural compliance subject to a volume constraint. Special considerations are given for ensuring positive definiteness of the constitutive matrix and promoting macroscale connectivity. Several numerical examples are provided to showcase the proposed method.

To address this issue, we present MTMMC, a real-world, large-scale dataset that includes long video sequences captured by 16 multi-modal cameras in two different environments - campus and factory - across various time, weather, and season conditions.

We propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to deal with the challenges of dynamic environments and difficult-to-obtain data in CPS optimization. In this paper, we present a case study that employs LLM agents to mimic the behaviors and thermal preferences of various population groups (e.g. young families, the elderly) in a shopping mall. The aggregated thermal preferences are integrated into an agent-in-the-loop based reinforcement learning algorithm AitL-RL, which employs the LLM as a dynamic simulation of the physical environment to learn how to balance between energy savings and occupant comfort. Our results show that LLMs are capable of simulating complex population movements within large open spaces. Besides, AitL-RL demonstrates superior performance compared to the popular existing policy of set point control, suggesting that adaptive and personalized decision-making is critical for efficient optimization in CPS-IoT applications. Through this case study, we demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced Foundation Models like LLMs into CPS-IoT to enhance system adaptability and efficiency. The project's code can be found on our GitHub repository.

However, current models often fail to detect pedestrians in certain cases (e.g., thermal-obscured pedestrians), particularly due to the modality bias learned from statistically biased datasets. In this paper, we investigate how to mitigate modality bias in multispectral pedestrian detection using Large Language Models (LLMs). Accordingly, we design a Multispectral Chain-of-Thought (MSCoT) prompting strategy, which prompts the LLM to perform multispectral pedestrian detection. Moreover, we propose a novel Multispectral Chain-of-Thought Detection (MSCoTDet) framework that integrates MSCoT prompting into multispectral pedestrian detection. To this end, we design a Language-driven Multi-modal Fusion (LMF) strategy that enables fusing the outputs of MSCoT prompting with the detection results of vision-based multispectral pedestrian detection models. Extensive experiments validate that MSCoTDet effectively mitigates modality biases and improves multispectral pedestrian detection.

However, the modality bias problem remains unsolved as multispectral pedestrian detectors learn the statistical bias in datasets. Specifically, datasets in multispectral pedestrian detection mainly distribute between ROTO (day) and RXTO (night) data; the majority of the pedestrian labels statistically co-occur with their thermal features. As a result, multispectral pedestrian detectors show poor generalization ability on examples beyond this statistical correlation, such as ROTX data. To address this problem, we propose a novel Causal Mode Multiplexer (CMM) framework that effectively learns the causalities between multispectral inputs and predictions. Moreover, we construct a new dataset (ROTX-MP) to evaluate modality bias in multispectral pedestrian detection. ROTX-MP mainly includes ROTX examples not presented in previous datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CMM framework generalizes well on existing datasets (KAIST, CVC-14, FLIR) and the new ROTX-MP. We will release our new dataset to the public for future research.

By leveraging the complementary properties between RGB and IR images, the object detection task can achieve reliable and robust object localization across a variety of lighting conditions, from daytime to nighttime environments. Most existing multi-modal object detection methods directly input the RGB and IR images into deep neural networks, resulting in inferior detection performance. We believe that this issue arises not only from the challenges associated with effectively integrating multimodal information but also from the presence of redundant features in both the RGB and IR modalities. The redundant information of each modality will exacerbates the fusion imprecision problems during propagation. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the human brain's mechanism for processing multimodal information and propose a novel coarse-to-fine perspective to purify and fuse features from both modalities. Specifically, following this perspective, we design a Redundant Spectrum Removal module to remove interfering information within each modality coarsely and a Dynamic Feature Selection module to finely select the desired features for feature fusion. To verify the effectiveness of the coarse-to-fine fusion strategy, we construct a new object detector called the Removal then Selection Detector (RSDet). Extensive experiments on three RGB-IR object detection datasets verify the superior performance of our method.

However, the effects of non-ideal characteristics of SiC MOSFETs and stray parameters (especially parasitic inductance) on switching losses need to be further evaluated. In this paper, a transient loss model based on SiC MOSFET and SiC Schottky barrier diode (SBD) switching pairs is proposed. The transient process analysis is simplified by time segmentation of the transient process of power switching devices. The electro-thermal simulation calculates the junction temperature and updates the temperature-related parameters with the proposed loss model and the thermal network model. A multi-rate data exchange strategy is proposed to solve the problem of disparity in timescales between circuit simulation and thermal network simulation. The CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFET device is used for the experimental verification. The experimental results verify the accuracy of the model which provides guidance for the circuit design of SiC MOSFETs. All the parameters of the loss model can be extracted from the datasheet, which is practical in power electronics design.

These missions include: the Polar Explorer (PE), In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), and Astrophysics Lunar Observatory (ALO) and Lunar Geological Exploration Mission (LGEM). Therefore, designing a multipurpose rover that can serve these missions is crucial. The rover needs to be compatible with three different mission scenarios, each with an independent payload, making flexibility the key driver. This study focuses on modularity in the rover's locomotion solution and autonomous on-board system. Moreover, the proposed EMRS solution has been tested at an analogue facility to prove the modular mobility concept. The tests involved the rover's mobility in a lunar soil simulant testbed and different locomotion modes in a rocky and uneven terrain, as well as robustness against obstacles and excavation of lunar regolith. As a result, the EMRS project has developed a multipurpose modular rover concept, with power, thermal control, insulation, and dust protection systems designed for further phases. This paper highlights the potential of the EMRS system for lunar exploration and the importance of modularity in rover design.

We derive an entropy functional which is convex, and which must be preserved in order to preserve model stability at the discrete level. The numerical method is provably entropy stable and conserves mass, buoyancy, vorticity, and energy. This is achieved by using novel entropy stable numerical fluxes, summation-by-parts principle, and splitting the pressure and convection operators so that we can circumvent the use of chain rule at the discrete level. Numerical simulations on a cubed sphere mesh are presented to verify the theoretical results. The numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness of the method for a regime of well developed turbulence, where it can be run stably without any dissipation. The entropy stable fluxes are sufficient to control the grid scale noise generated by geostrophic turbulence, eliminating the need for artificial stabilisation.

A passive and contactless indoor stress monitoring system can unlock numerous important applications such as workplace productivity assessment, smart homes, and personalized mental health monitoring. While the thermal signatures from a user's body captured by a thermal camera can provide important information about the "fight-flight" response of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, relying solely on thermal imaging for training a stress prediction model often lead to overfitting and consequently a suboptimal performance. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing ThermaStrain, a novel co-teaching framework that achieves high-stress prediction performance by transferring knowledge from the wearable modality to the contactless thermal modality. During training, ThermaStrain incorporates a wearable electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor to generate stress-indicative representations from thermal videos, emulating stress-indicative representations from a wearable EDA sensor. During testing, only thermal sensing is used, and stress-indicative patterns from thermal data and emulated EDA representations are extracted to improve stress assessment. The study collected a comprehensive dataset with thermal video and EDA data under various stress conditions and distances. ThermaStrain achieves an F1 score of 0.8293 in binary stress classification, outperforming the thermal-only baseline approach by over 9%. Extensive evaluations highlight ThermaStrain's effectiveness in recognizing stress-indicative attributes, its adaptability across distances and stress scenarios, real-time executability on edge platforms, its applicability to multi-individual sensing, ability to function on limited visibility and unfamiliar conditions, and the advantages of its co-teaching approach.

We proposed to mitigate this issue by collapsing the T2TCL volume into a surface and using a so-called thin shell approximation (TSA). Previously, two TSA have been introduced, one to solve the heat equation and the other for an $\vec{H}-Ï$ magnetodynamic formulation.
  In this work, we propose to combine the magnetodynamic and thermal TSA to create a coupled magneto-thermal TSA for three-dimensional FE analysis. Particular attention is paid to the detailed derivation of the coupling terms. In the context of NI HTS pancake coils, the TSA represents the electric and thermal contact resistance of the T2TCL. For the HTS coated conductor (CC) itself, an anisotropic homogenization is used which represents its multi-layered structure. In axial and azimuthal direction, it resolves the current sharing between the HTS and other layers of the CC. The coupled TSA formulation is verified against a reference model with volumetric T2TCL. The coupled TSA is shown to significantly reduce the solution time as well as the manual effort required for high-quality meshes of the T2TCL. The implementation is open-source and a reference implementation is made publicly available.

We formulate it as an online constrained black-box optimization problem where, on each day, we observe some relevant environmental context and adaptively select the controller parameters. In this paper, we propose to use a data-driven Primal-Dual Contextual Bayesian Optimization (PDCBO) approach to solve this problem. In a simulation case study on a single room, we apply our algorithm to tune the parameters of a Proportional Integral (PI) heating controller and the pre-heating time. Our results show that PDCBO can save up to 4.7% energy consumption compared to other state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization-based methods while keeping the daily thermal discomfort below the given tolerable threshold on average. Additionally, PDCBO can automatically track time-varying tolerable thresholds while existing methods fail to do so. We then study an alternative constrained tuning problem where we aim to minimize the thermal discomfort with a given energy budget. With this formulation, PDCBO reduces the average discomfort by up to 63% compared to state-of-the-art safe optimization methods while keeping the average daily energy consumption below the required threshold.

As a result, when Nature cools a quantum system in a low-temperature thermal bath, the ground state cannot always be found efficiently. Instead, Nature finds a local minimum of the energy. In this work, we study the problem of finding local minima in quantum systems under thermal perturbations. While local minima are much easier to find than ground states, we show that finding a local minimum is computationally hard for classical computers, even when the task is to output a single-qubit observable at any local minimum. In contrast, we prove that a quantum computer can always find a local minimum efficiently using a thermal gradient descent algorithm that mimics the cooling process in Nature. To establish the classical hardness of finding local minima, we consider a family of two-dimensional Hamiltonians such that any problem solvable by polynomial-time quantum algorithms can be reduced to finding ground states of these Hamiltonians. We prove that for such Hamiltonians, all local minima are global minima. Therefore, assuming quantum computation is more powerful than classical computation, finding local minima is classically hard and quantumly easy.

However, collecting a huge amount of labeled cough dataset is challenging mainly due to high laborious expenses, data scarcity, and privacy concerns. In this work, our aim is to develop a framework that can effectively perform cough classification even in situations when enormous cough data is not available, while also addressing privacy concerns. Specifically, we formulate a new problem to tackle these challenges and adopt few-shot learning and federated learning to design a novel framework, termed F2LCough, for solving the newly formulated problem. We illustrate the superiority of our method compared with other approaches on COVID-19 Thermal Face & Cough dataset, in which F2LCough achieves an average F1-Score of 86%. Our results show the feasibility of few-shot learning combined with federated learning to build a classification model of cough sounds. This new methodology is able to classify cough sounds in data-scarce situations and maintain privacy properties. The outcomes of this work can be a fundamental framework for building support systems for the detection and diagnosis of cough-related diseases.

Understanding and being able to predict the impact of thermal radiation are therefore critical to accurate determination of the drying process endpoint given the variation in heat transfer of each vial. This article presents a new mechanistic model that describes complex thermal radiation during primary drying in conventional, microwave-assisted, and hybrid freeze drying. Modeling of thermal radiation employs the diffuse gray surface model and radiation network approach, which systematically and accurately incorporates simultaneous radiation exchange between every surface including the chamber wall and vials, allowing the framework to be seamlessly applied for analyzing various freeze-dryer designs. Model validation with data from the literature shows accurate prediction of the drying times for all vials, including inner, edge, and corner vials. The validated model is demonstrated for thermal radiation analysis and parametric studies to guide the design and optimization of freeze dryers.

While energy conservation can be enforced via the preservation of the skew-symmetric structure of the Hamiltonian form of the equations of motion, entropy conservation is typically derived as an additional invariant of the Hamiltonian system, and satisfied via the exact preservation of the chain rule. This is particularly challenging since the function spaces used to represent the thermodynamic variables in compatible finite element discretisations are typically discontinuous at element boundaries. In the present work we negate this problem by constructing our equations of motion via weighted averages of skew-symmetric formulations using both flux form and material form advection of thermodynamic variables, which allow for the necessary cancellations required to conserve entropy without the chain rule. We show that such formulations allow for stable simulations of both the thermal shallow water and 3D compressible Euler equations on the sphere using mixed compatible finite elements without entropy damping.

A SmartSSD is a solid-state disk (SSD) augmented with an FPGA. Through public cloud providers, it is now possible to rent on-demand virtual machines enabled with SmartSSDs. Because of the FPGA component of the SmartSSD, cloud users who access the SmartSSD can instantiate custom circuits within the FPGA. This includes possibly malicious circuits for measurement of power and temperature. Normally, cloud users have no remote access to power and temperature data, but with SmartSSDs they could abuse the FPGA component to learn this information. This paper shows for the first time that heat generated by a cloud user accessing the SSD component of the SmartSSD and the resulting temperature increase, can be measured by a different cloud user accessing the FPGA component of the same SmartSSD by using the ring oscillators circuits to measure temperature. The thermal state remains elevated for a few minutes after the SSD is heated up and can be measured from the FPGA side by a subsequent user for up to a few minutes after the SSD heating is done. Further, in a future multi-tenant SmartSSD setting, the thermal changes can be measured in parallel if one user controls the SSD and the other the FPGA. Based on this temporal thermal state of the SmartSSD, a novel thermal communication channel is demonstrated for the first time.

We propose a physics-guided material classification framework that relies on thermal properties of the object. Our key observation is that the rate of heating and cooling of an object depends on the unique intrinsic properties of the material, namely the emissivity and diffusivity. We leverage this observation by gently heating the objects in the scene with a low-power laser for a fixed duration and then turning it off, while a thermal camera captures measurements during the heating and cooling process. We then take this spatial and temporal "thermal spread function" (TSF) to solve an inverse heat equation using the finite-differences approach, resulting in a spatially varying estimate of diffusivity and emissivity. These tuples are then used to train a classifier that produces a fine-grained material label at each spatial pixel. Our approach is extremely simple requiring only a small light source (low power laser) and a thermal camera, and produces robust classification results with 86% accuracy over 16 classes.

Due to a lack of annotated data, existing literature utilized a multiple-threshold method to separate the bubbles and calculate bubble statistics on an annular fuel. However, the multiple-threshold method cannot achieve robust performance on images with different qualities and contrasts, and cannot distinguish different bubbles. This paper proposes a hybrid framework for efficient bubble segmentation. We develop a bubble annotation tool and generate the first fission gas bubble dataset with more than 3000 bubbles from 24 images. A multi-task deep learning network integrating U-Net and ResNet is designed to accomplish instance-level bubble segmentation. Combining the segmentation results and image processing step achieves the best recall ratio of more than 90% with very limited annotated data. Our model shows outstanding improvement by comparing the previously proposed thresholding method. The proposed method has promising to generate a more accurate quantitative analysis of fission gas bubbles on U-10Zr annular fuels. The results will contribute to identifying the bubbles with lanthanides and finally build the relationship between the thermal gradation and lanthanides movements of U-10Zr annular fuels. Mover, the deep learning model is applicable to other similar material micro-structure segmentation tasks.

Yet, extending these findings to group communication is missing. We investigated how thermal signals can be used to communicate group affective states in a hybrid meeting scenario to help people feel connected over a distance. We conducted a lab study (N=20 participants) and explored wrist-worn thermal feedback to communicate audience emotions. Our results show that thermal feedback is an effective method of conveying audience engagement without increasing workload and can help a presenter feel more in tune with the audience. We outline design implications for real-world wearable social thermal feedback systems for both virtual and in-person communication that support group affect communication and social connectedness. Thermal feedback has the potential to connect people across distances and facilitate more effective and dynamic communication in multiple contexts.

Increasing power density and limited assembly space pose high demands on thermal management. Large cooling surfaces need to be covered efficiently. When joining the heatsink, previously dispensed TIM spreads over the cooling surface. Recommendations on the dispensing pattern exist only for simple surface geometries such as rectangles. For more complex geometries, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are used in combination with manual experiments. While CFD simulations offer a high accuracy, they involve simulation experts and are rather expensive to set up. We propose a lightweight heuristic to model the spreading behavior of TIM. We further speed up the calculation by training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on data from this model. This offers rapid computation times and further supplies gradient information. This ANN can not only be used to aid manual pattern design of TIM, but also enables an automated pattern optimization. We compare this approach against the state-of-the-art and use real product samples for validation.

Employing the familiar Poisson equation describing the electric potential evolution in a material exhibiting insulator-to-metal transitions, we exploit a special property of such an integral boundary condition, and we properly formulate the variational problem and establish its well-posedness. We then compare our method with the commonly-used Lagrange multiplier method that can also handle such boundary conditions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our new method achieves an optimal convergence rate in contrast to the conventional Lagrange multiplier method. Furthermore, the linear system derived from our method is symmetric positive definite, and can be efficiently solved by Conjugate Gradient method with algebraic multigrid preconditioning.

The main bottleneck of this method is the choice of regularization parameters which differs for each experiment. To avoid time-consuming manually selected regularization parameter, we propose a learned block-sparse optimization approach using an iterative algorithm unfolded into a deep neural network. More precisely, we show the benefits of using a learned block iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm that is able to learn the choice of regularization parameters. In addition, this algorithm enables the determination of a suitable weight matrix to solve the underlying inverse problem. Therefore, in this paper we present the algorithm and compare it with state of the art block iterative shrinkage thresholding using synthetically generated test data and experimental test data from active thermography for defect reconstruction. Our results show that the use of the learned block-sparse optimization approach provides smaller normalized mean square errors for a small fixed number of iterations than without learning. Thus, this new approach allows to improve the convergence speed and only needs a few iterations to generate accurate defect reconstruction in photothermal super resolution imaging.

However, a building's predicted flexibility potential is based on uncertain ambient weather forecasts and a typically inaccurate building thermal model. Hence, this paper presents an uncertainty-aware flexibility quantifier using a chance-constrained formulation. Because such a quantifier may be conservative, we additionally model real-time feedback in the quantification, in the form of affine feedback policies. Such adaptation can take the form of intra-day trades or rebound around the flexibility provision period. To assess the flexibility quantification formulations, we further assume that flexible buildings participate in secondary frequency control markets. The results show some increase in flexibility and revenues when introducing affine feedback policies. Additionally, it is demonstrated that accounting for uncertainties in the flexibility quantification is necessary, especially when intra-day trades are not available. Even though an uncertainty-ignorant potential may seem financially profitable in secondary frequency control markets, it comes at the cost of significant thermal discomfort for inhabitants. Hence, we suggest a comfort-preserving approach, aiming to truly reflect thermal discomfort on the economic flexibility revenue, to obtain a fairer comparison.

In this context, novel analog filamentary conductive-metal-oxide (CMO)/HfOx redox-based resistive switching memory (ReRAM) represents a key technology. Despite device performance enhancements reported in literature, the underlying mechanism behind resistive switching is not fully understood. This work presents the first physics-based analytical model of the current transport and of the resistive switching in these devices. As a case study, analog TaOx/HfOx ReRAM devices are considered. The current transport is explained by a trap-to-trap tunneling process, and the resistive switching by a modulation of the defect density within the sub-band of the TaOx that behaves as electric field and temperature confinement layer. The local temperature and electric field distributions are derived from the solution of the electric and heat transport equations in a 3D finite element ReRAM model. The intermediate resistive states are described as a gradual modulation of the TaOx defect density, which results in a variation of its electrical conductivity. The drift-dynamics of ions during the resistive switching is analytically described, allowing the estimation of defect migration energies in the TaOx layer. Moreover, the role of the electro-thermal properties of the CMO layer is unveiled. The proposed analytical model accurately describes the experimental switching characteristic of analog TaOx/HfOx ReRAM devices, increasing the physical understanding and providing the equations necessary for circuit simulations incorporating this technology.

Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent solutions. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space, leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients efficiently and accurately. This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers. Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader engineering applications.

This paper introduces ProMSC-MIS, a novel Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication framework for Multi-Spectral Image Segmentation. It enables efficient task-oriented transmission of spatially aligned RGB and thermal images over band-limited channels. Our framework has two main design novelties. First, by leveraging prompt learning and contrastive learning, unimodal semantic encoders are pre-trained to learn diverse and complementary semantic representations by using features from one modality as prompts for another. Second, a semantic fusion module that combines cross-attention mechanism and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) networks is designed to effectively fuse cross-modal features. Experimental results demonstrate that ProMSC-MIS substantially outperforms conventional image transmission combined with state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Notably, it reduces the required channel bandwidth by 50%--70% at the same segmentation performance, while also decreasing the storage overhead and computational complexity by 26% and 37%, respectively. Ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training and semantic fusion strategies. Our scheme is highly suitable for applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.

However, as an indirect method, extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data. The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only 35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV systems.

Yet, many existing approaches overlook essential chemical constraints such as oxidation state balance, which can lead to chemically invalid structures. Here we introduce CrysVCD (Crystal generator with Valence-Constrained Design), a modular framework that integrates chemical rules directly into the generative process. CrysVCD first employs a transformer-based elemental language model to generate valence-balanced compositions, followed by a diffusion model to generate crystal structures. The valence constraint enables orders-of-magnitude more efficient chemical valence checking, compared to pure data-driven approaches with post-screening. When fine-tuned on stability metrics, CrysVCD achieves 85% thermodynamic stability and 68% phonon stability. Moreover, CrysVCD supports conditional generation of functional materials, enabling discovery of candidates such as high thermal conductivity semiconductors and high-$Îº$ dielectric compounds. Designed as a general-purpose plugin, CrysVCD can be integrated into diverse generative pipeline to promote chemical validity, offering a reliable, scientifically grounded path for materials discovery.

This minimizes environmental impacts, supports sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools, limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.

They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras.

However, due to the shrinking device size, self-heating and inter-device thermal crosstalk of NSFETs and CFETs become more severe. It is important to accurately calculate the self-heating and thermal crosstalk of devices and to study the electrical and thermal characteristics of logic gates, etc. In this work, a thermal network model considering the thermal crosstalk of neighboring devices is proposed, which can accurately calculate the self-heating and thermal crosstalk. The electrical and thermal characteristics of NSFETs and CFETs are compared, and it is found that CFETs have more severe self-heating and thermal crosstalk. The electro-thermal characteristics of inverters, logic gates and ring oscillators composed of NSFETs and CFETs are further investigated. Compared with NSFETs, logic gates and ring oscillators composed of CFETs are more seriously affected by self-heating and should be given extra attention. The thermal network model proposed in this paper can be further used to study the thermal optimization strategy of devices and circuits to enhance the electrical performance, achieving the design technology co-optimizations (DTCO).

Recently, machine learning for the inverse design of metamaterials has drawn attention. However, the highly nonlinear relationship between the metamaterial structures and optical behaviour, coupled with fabrication difficulties, poses challenges for using machine learning to design and manufacture complex metamaterials. Herein, we propose a general framework that implements customised spectrum-to-shape and size parameters to address one-to-many metamaterial inverse design problems using conditional diffusion models. Our method exhibits superior spectral prediction accuracy, generates a diverse range of patterns compared to other typical generative models, and offers valuable prior knowledge for manufacturing through the subsequent analysis of the diverse generated results, thereby facilitating the experimental fabrication of metamaterial designs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by successfully designing and fabricating a free-form metamaterial with a tailored selective emission spectrum for thermal camouflage applications.

In the proposed method, historical optimal decisions are first generated using a neural network-assisted Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (HMPC) framework. These decisions are then used as expert demonstrations in the AIRL module, which aims to train a discriminator to distinguish expert demonstrations from transitions generated by a reinforcement learning agent policy, while simultaneously updating the agent policy that can produce transitions to confuse the discriminator. The proposed HMPC-AIRL method eliminates the need for explicit thermal dynamics models, prior or predictive knowledge of uncertain parameters, or manually designed reward functions. Simulation results based on real-world traces demonstrate the effectiveness and data efficiency of the proposed method.

Although deep learning approaches have advanced the extraction of physiological signals from video data, existing methods have not been sufficiently assessed for their robustness to domain shifts. These shifts in remote physiological sensing include variations in ambient conditions, camera specifications, head movements, facial poses, and physiological states which often impact real-world performance significantly. Cross-dataset evaluation provides an objective measure to assess generalization capabilities across these domain shifts. We introduce Target Signal Constrained Factorization module (TSFM), a novel multidimensional attention mechanism that explicitly incorporates physiological signal characteristics as factorization constraints, allowing more precise feature extraction. Building on this innovation, we present MMRPhys, an efficient dual-branch 3D-CNN architecture designed for simultaneous multitask estimation of photoplethysmography (rPPG) and respiratory (rRSP) signals from multimodal RGB and thermal video inputs. Through comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation on five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MMRPhys with TSFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalization across domain shifts for rPPG and rRSP estimation, while maintaining a minimal inference latency suitable for real-time applications. Our approach establishes new benchmarks for robust multitask and multimodal physiological sensing and offers a computationally efficient framework for practical deployment in unconstrained environments. The web browser-based application featuring on-device real-time inference of MMRPhys model is available at https://physiologicailab.github.io/mmrphys-live

Tunnels present a uniquely difficult scenario: they are not only prone to GNSS signal loss, but also provide little features for visual localization due to their repetitive walls and poor lighting. These conditions degrade conventional vision-based and LiDAR-based systems, which rely on distinguishable environmental features. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion framework that integrates a thermal camera with a LiDAR to enable robust localization in tunnels and other perceptually degraded environments. The thermal camera provides resilience in low-light or smoke conditions, while the LiDAR delivers precise depth perception and structural awareness. By combining these sensors, our framework ensures continuous and accurate localization across diverse and dynamic environments. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse multi-sensor inputs, and leverages visual odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to process the sensor data, enabling robust motion estimation and mapping even in GNSS-denied environments. This fusion of sensor modalities not only enhances system resilience but also provides a scalable solution for cyber-physical systems in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To validate the framework, we conduct tests in a tunnel environment, simulating sensor degradation and visibility challenges. The results demonstrate that our method sustains accurate localization where standard approaches deteriorate due to the tunnels featureless geometry. The frameworks versatility makes it a promising solution for autonomous vehicles, inspection robots, and other cyber-physical systems operating in constrained, perceptually poor environments.

Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process. Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.

This is a shift from using traditional physics-based models within MHE towards data-driven techniques. Specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based DNN is trained using synthetic data derived from a high-fidelity thermal model of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM), applied within a thermal derating torque control strategy for battery electric vehicles. The trained DNN is directly embedded within an MHE formulation, forming a discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problem (OCP) solved via the acados optimization framework. Model-in-the-Loop simulations demonstrate accurate temperature estimation even under noisy sensor conditions and simulated sensor failures. Real-time implementation on embedded hardware confirms practical feasibility, achieving computational performance exceeding real-time requirements threefold. By integrating the learned LSTM-based dynamics directly into MHE, this work achieves state estimation accuracy, robustness, and adaptability while reducing modeling efforts and complexity. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness of combining model-based and data-driven methods in safety-critical automotive control systems.

Nevertheless, this topic has already been addressed by methodologies belonging to the Reduced Order Modelling framework, of which perhaps the most famous equation-free technique is Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This algorithm aims to learn the best linear model that represents the physical phenomena described by a time series dataset: its output is a best state operator of the underlying dynamical system that can be used, in principle, to advance the original dataset in time even beyond its span. However, in its standard formulation, this technique cannot deal with parametric time series, meaning that a different linear model has to be derived for each parameter realization. Research on this is ongoing, and some versions of a parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition already exist. This work contributes to this research field by comparing the different algorithms presently deployed and assessing their advantages and shortcomings compared to each other. To this aim, three different thermal-hydraulics problems are considered: two benchmark 'flow over cylinder' test cases at diverse Reynolds numbers, whose datasets are, respectively, obtained with the FEniCS finite element solver and retrieved from the CFDbench dataset, and the DYNASTY experimental facility operating at Politecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by internally heated fluids for Generation IV nuclear applications, whose dataset was generated using the RELAP5 nodal solver.

Here, we introduce CrossMatAgent -- a novel multi-agent framework that synergistically integrates large language models with state-of-the-art generative AI to revolutionize metamaterial design. By orchestrating a hierarchical team of agents -- each specializing in tasks such as pattern analysis, architectural synthesis, prompt engineering, and supervisory feedback -- our system leverages the multimodal reasoning of GPT-4o alongside the generative precision of DALL-E 3 and a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model. This integrated approach automates data augmentation, enhances design fidelity, and produces simulation- and 3D printing-ready metamaterial patterns. Comprehensive evaluations, including CLIP-based alignment, SHAP interpretability analyses, and mechanical simulations under varied load conditions, demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diverse, reproducible, and application-ready designs. CrossMatAgent thus establishes a scalable, AI-driven paradigm that bridges the gap between conceptual innovation and practical realization, paving the way for accelerated metamaterial development.

However, high-temperature solar receivers face severe operational risks, such as freezing, deformation, and corrosion, resulting in costly downtime and maintenance. To monitor CSP plants, cameras mounted on solar receivers record infrared images at irregular intervals ranging from one to five minutes throughout the day. Anomalous images can be detected by thresholding an anomaly score, where the threshold is chosen to optimize metrics such as the F1-score on a validation set. This work proposes a framework, using risk control, for generating more reliable decision thresholds with finite-sample coverage guarantees on any chosen risk function. Our framework also incorporates an abstention mechanism, allowing high-risk predictions to be deferred to domain experts. Second, we propose a density forecasting method to estimate the likelihood of an observed image given a sequence of previously observed images, using this likelihood as its anomaly score. Third, we analyze the deployment results of our framework across multiple training scenarios over several months for two CSP plants. This analysis provides valuable insights to our industry partner for optimizing maintenance operations. Finally, given the confidential nature of our dataset, we provide an extended simulated dataset, leveraging recent advancements in generative modeling to create diverse thermal images that simulate multiple CSP plants. Our code is publicly available.

Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.

These systems leverage the relatively stable underground temperature to regulate indoor climates, reducing reliance on conventional heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. This review systematically categorizes and synthesizes research on EAHEs into three primary areas: analytical, numerical, and exergoeconomic studies. Analytical approaches focus on developing theoretical models to predict thermal performance, while numerical simulations provide insights into system optimization and real-world applications. Exergoeconomic analyses, integrating thermodynamic efficiency with economic considerations, offer valuable perspectives on cost-effectiveness and long-term viability. By consolidating existing contributions across these domains, this study serves as a comprehensive reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers seeking to enhance the design, implementation, and performance of EAHE systems. The findings emphasize the pivotal role of EAHEs in reducing energy consumption, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improving economic sustainability. Additionally, this review identifies key challenges, including soil thermal conductivity variations, moisture effects, and system integration with renewable energy sources, which require further investigation. By addressing these challenges, EAHEs can be further optimized to serve as a cornerstone in sustainable energy management, contributing to global efforts toward energy-efficient building solutions and climate change mitigation.

As an exemplary application, transient load control is demonstrated on a single-cylinder internal combustion engine testbench in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) mode, that offers high thermal efficiency and low emissions. However, HCCI poses challenges for traditional control methods due to its nonlinear, autoregressive, and stochastic nature. RL provides a viable solution, however, safety concerns, such as excessive pressure rise rates, must be addressed when applying to HCCI. A single unsuitable control input can severely damage the engine or cause misfiring and shut down. Additionally, operating limits are not known a priori and must be determined experimentally. To mitigate these risks, real-time safety monitoring based on the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is implemented, enabling safe interaction with the testbench. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated as the RL agent learns a control policy through interaction with the testbench. A root mean square error of 0.1374 bar is achieved for the indicated mean effective pressure, comparable to neural network-based controllers from the literature. The toolchain's flexibility is further demonstrated by adapting the agent's policy to increase ethanol energy shares, promoting renewable fuel use while maintaining safety. This RL approach addresses the longstanding challenge of applying RL to safety-critical real-world environments. The developed toolchain, with its adaptability and safety mechanisms, paves the way for future applicability of RL in engine testbenches and other safety-critical settings.

The strategy is based on (i) a mathematical model of a convection-dominated problem coupling thermal convection and turbulence, and (ii) a least-squares approach for solving the inverse data assimilation problem, regularized by projecting the governing dynamics onto a reduced-order model (ROM). The unsteady freezing process considers a salmon slice in a freezer cabinet, modeled with temperature-dependent thermophysical properties. The forward problem is approximated using a third-order WENO finite volume solver, including an optimized second-order backward scheme for time discretization. We employ our data assimilation framework to reconstruct the temperature field based on a limited number of sensors and to estimate temperature distributions within frozen food. Sensor placement is optimized using a novel greedy algorithm, which maximizes the observability of the reduced-order dynamics for a fixed set of sensors. The proposed approach allows efficient extrapolation from external sensor measurements to the internal temperature of the food under realistic turbulent flow conditions, which is crucial for maintaining food quality.

Here, we develop a comprehensive physical model to investigate how electrical and thermal conductivities influence CF dynamics in TaOx-based memristors. Our simulations reveal that higher electrical conductivity promotes oxygen vacancy generation and reduces forming voltage, while higher thermal conductivity enhances heat dissipation, leading to increased forming voltage. The uniformity of resistive switching is strongly dependent on the interplay between these transport properties. We identify two distinct pathways for achieving optimal High Resistance State (HRS) uniformity with standard deviation-to-mean ratios as low as 0.045, each governed by different balances of electrical and thermal transport mechanisms. For the Low Resistance State (LRS), high uniformity (0.009) can be maintained when either electrical or thermal conductivity is low. The resistance ratio between HRS and LRS shows a strong dependence on these conductivities, with higher ratios observed at lower conductivity values. These findings provide essential guidelines for material selection in RRAM devices, particularly for applications demanding high reliability and uniform switching characteristics.

The dwell time distribution in each state is exponential. We sample this distribution using a temporal encoding scheme, in which information is encoded in the time at which the device switches between its resistance states. We then develop a circuit element known as a probabilistic delay cell that applies an electrical current step to a superparamagnetic tunnel junction and a temporal measurement circuit that measures the timing of the first switching event. Repeated experiments confirm that these times are exponentially distributed. Temporal processing methods then allow us to digitally compute with these exponentially distributed probabilistic delay cells. We describe how to use these circuits in a Metropolis-Hastings stepper and in a weighted random sampler, both of which are computationally intensive applications that benefit from the efficient generation of exponentially distributed random numbers.

Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with Galerkin projection (GP) has shown to offer high accuracy and massive runtime improvements over direct numerical simulation (DNS). However, previous implementations of POD-GP use MPI-based libraries like PETSc and FEniCS and face significant runtime bottlenecks. We propose a $\textbf{Py}$Torch-based $\textbf{POD-GP}$ library (PyPOD-GP), a GPU-optimized library for chip-level thermal simulation. PyPOD-GP achieves over $23.4\times$ speedup in training and over $10\times$ speedup in inference on a GPU with over 13,000 cores, with just $1.2\%$ error over the device layer.

To automate this process, the task can be phrased as a classification problem. Classification problems can be approached in two fundamentally distinct ways: through either a discriminative or a generative method. In general, it is unclear which of these two approaches is most suitable for a given problem. The choice is expected to depend on factors such as the availability of system knowledge, dataset size, desired accuracy, computational resources, and other considerations. In this work, we answer the question of how one should approach the solution of phase-classification problems by performing a numerical case study on the thermal phase transition in the classical two-dimensional square-lattice ferromagnetic Ising model.

Accurate anomaly detection is the prerequisite for ensuring the safe and stable operation of steam turbines. However, challenges in steam turbine anomaly detection, including inherent anomalies, lack of temporal information analysis, and high-dimensional data complexity, limit the effectiveness of existing methods. To address these challenges, we proposed an Enhanced Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder using Deep Advanced Features and Gaussian Mixture Model (ELSTMVAE-DAF-GMM) for precise unsupervised anomaly detection in unlabeled datasets. Specifically, LSTMVAE, integrating LSTM with VAE, was used to project high-dimensional time-series data to a low-dimensional phase space. The Deep Autoencoder-Local Outlier Factor (DAE-LOF) sample selection mechanism was used to eliminate inherent anomalies during training, further improving the model's precision and reliability. The novel deep advanced features (DAF) hybridize latent embeddings and reconstruction discrepancies from the LSTMVAE model and provide a more comprehensive data representation within a continuous and structured phase space, significantly enhancing anomaly detection by synergizing temporal dynamics with data pattern variations. These DAF were incorporated into GMM to ensure robust and effective unsupervised anomaly detection. We utilized real operating data from industry steam turbines and conducted both comparison and ablation experiments, demonstrating superior anomaly detection outcomes characterized by high accuracy and minimal false alarm rates compared with existing methods.

This formulation is derived using an envelope ansatz for the vector-valued electric and magnetic field components, factoring out an oscillatory term of $exp(-i \mathsf{k}z)$ with a user-defined wavenumber $\mathsf{k}$, where $z$ is the longitudinal fiber axis and field propagation direction. The resulting formulation is a modified system of the time-harmonic Maxwell equations for the vectorial envelope of the propagating field. This envelope is less oscillatory in the $z$-direction than the original field, so that it can be more efficiently discretized and computed, enabling solution of the vectorial DPG Maxwell system for $1000\times$ longer fibers than previously possible. Different approaches for incorporating a perfectly matched layer for absorbing the outgoing wave modes at the fiber end are derived and compared numerically. The resulting formulation is used to solve a 3D Maxwell model of an ytterbium-doped active gain fiber amplifier, coupled with the heat equation for including thermal effects. The nonlinear model is then used to simulate thermally-induced transverse mode instability (TMI). The numerical experiments demonstrate that it is computationally feasible to perform simulations and analysis of real-length optical fiber laser amplifiers using discretizations of the full vectorial time-harmonic Maxwell equations. The approach promises a new high-fidelity methodology for analyzing TMI in high-power fiber laser systems and is extendable to including other nonlinearities.

Indeed, high-quality visual sensors are expensive, and consumer-grade sensors produce low-resolution images. Researchers have developed methods to combine RGB color images with non-visual data, such as thermal, to overcome this limitation to improve resolution. Fusing multiple modalities to produce visually appealing, high-resolution images often requires dense models with millions of parameters and a heavy computational load, which is commonly attributed to the intricate architecture of the model.
  We propose LapGSR, a multimodal, lightweight, generative model incorporating Laplacian image pyramids for guided thermal super-resolution. This approach uses a Laplacian Pyramid on RGB color images to extract vital edge information, which is then used to bypass heavy feature map computation in the higher layers of the model in tandem with a combined pixel and adversarial loss. LapGSR preserves the spatial and structural details of the image while also being efficient and compact. This results in a model with significantly fewer parameters than other SOTA models while demonstrating excellent results on two cross-domain datasets viz. ULB17-VT and VGTSR datasets.

However, real-time implementation is challenging due to the multi-timescale dynamics and complex trade-offs between energy consumption, battery degradation, traffic efficiency, and thermal regulation. This paper proposes a novel integrated power and thermal management strategy based on the Multi-Horizon Model Predictive Control (MH-MPC) framework to enhance energy efficiency, optimize battery temperature, ensure traffic safety and efficiency, and reduce battery degradation for CAEVs. The proposed strategy is formulated with a focus on the aging term, allowing it to more effectively manage the trade-offs between energy consumption, battery degradation, and temperature regulation. Moreover, the proposed strategy leverages multi-horizon optimization to achieve substantial improvements, reducing computation time by 7.18%, cooling energy by 14.22%, traction energy by 8.26%, battery degradation loss by over 22%, and battery degradation inconsistency by 36.57% compared to the benchmark strategy. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses of key parameters, including weighting factors, sampling time, and prediction horizons, demonstrate the robustness of the strategy and underscore its potential for practical applications in extending battery lifespan while ensuring safety and efficiency.

In this work, we introduce an interpretable network for the MMIF task, named FNet, based on an l0-regularized multi-modal convolutional sparse coding (MCSC) model. Specifically, for solving the l0-regularized CSC problem, we develop an algorithm unrolling-based l0-regularized sparse coding (LZSC) block. Given different modality source images, FNet first separates the unique and common features from them using the LZSC block and then these features are combined to generate the final fused image. Additionally, we propose an l0-regularized MCSC model for the inverse fusion process. Based on this model, we introduce an interpretable inverse fusion network named IFNet, which is utilized during FNet's training. Extensive experiments show that FNet achieves high-quality fusion results across five different MMIF tasks. Furthermore, we show that FNet enhances downstream object detection in visible-thermal image pairs. We have also visualized the intermediate results of FNet, which demonstrates the good interpretability of our network.

These models assist circuit designers in the design and the early assessment of the performance of their systems. The Heracles model is a physics-based compact model for circuit simulations in a SPICE environment for HfO2-based ferroelectric capacitors (FeCaps). The model has been calibrated based on experimental data obtained from HfO2-based FeCaps. A thermal model with an accurate description of the device parasitics is included to derive precise device characteristics based on first principles. The incorporation of statistical device data enables Monte Carlo analysis based on realistic distributions, thereby rendering the model particularly well-suited for design-technology co-optimization (DTCO). The model's efficacy is further demonstrated in circuit simulations using an integrated circuit with current programming, wherein partial switching of the ferroelectric polarization is observed. Finally, the model was benchmarked in an array simulation, reaching convergence in 1.8 s with an array size of 100 kb.

It further empowers the development of digital twins that are sufficiently accurate for real-world deployment. As nuclear engineering systems are typically characterised by extreme environments, their in-core sensing is a challenging task, even more so in Generation-IV reactor concepts, which feature molten salt or liquid metals as thermal carriers. The emergence of data-driven methods allows for new techniques for accurate and robust estimation of the full state space vector characterising the reactor (mainly composed by neutron fluxes and the thermal-hydraulics fields). These techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, in order to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the Shallow Recurrent Decoder (SHRED) architecture to estimate the entire state vector of a reactor from three, out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. Specifically, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor, in the EVOL geometry (Evaluation and Viability of Liquid Fuel Fast Reactor System project), is demonstrated as a test case, with neutron flux measurements alone allowing for reconstruction of the 20 coupled field variables of the dynamics. This approach can further quantify the uncertainty associated with the state estimation due to its considerably low training cost on compressed data. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.

This paper examines the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in wildlife conservation, focusing on the Conservation AI platform. Leveraging machine learning and computer vision, Conservation AI detects and classifies animals, humans, and poaching-related objects using visual spectrum and thermal infrared cameras. The platform processes this data with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures to monitor species, including those which are critically endangered. Real-time detection provides the immediate responses required for time-critical situations (e.g. poaching), while non-real-time analysis supports long-term wildlife monitoring and habitat health assessment. Case studies from Europe, North America, Africa, and Southeast Asia highlight the platform's success in species identification, biodiversity monitoring, and poaching prevention. The paper also discusses challenges related to data quality, model accuracy, and logistical constraints, while outlining future directions involving technological advancements, expansion into new geographical regions, and deeper collaboration with local communities and policymakers. Conservation AI represents a significant step forward in addressing the urgent challenges of wildlife conservation, offering a scalable and adaptable solution that can be implemented globally.

Given the severe constraints on the cooling capacity in cryogenic environments, thermal design is crucial for the scalability of these computers. The sources of heat dissipation include passive inflow via inter-temperature wires and the power consumption of components located in the cryostat, such as wire amplifiers and quantum-classical interfaces. Thus, a critical challenge is to reduce the number of wires by reducing the required inter-temperature bandwidth while maintaining minimal additional power consumption in the cryostat. One solution to address this challenge is near-data processing using ultra-low-power computational logic within the cryostat. Based on the workload analysis and domain-specific system design focused on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), we propose the Cryogenic Counter-based Co-processor for VQAs (C3-VQA) to enhance the design scalability of cryogenic quantum computers under the thermal constraint. The C3-VQA utilizes single-flux-quantum logic, which is an ultra-low-power superconducting digital circuit that operates at the 4 K environment. The C3-VQA precomputes a part of the expectation value calculations for VQAs and buffers intermediate values using simple bit operation units and counters in the cryostat, thereby reducing the required inter-temperature bandwidth with small additional power consumption. Consequently, the C3-VQA reduces the number of wires, leading to a reduction in the total heat dissipation in the cryostat. Our evaluation shows that the C3-VQA reduces the total heat dissipation at the 4 K stage by 30% and 81% under sequential-shot and parallel-shot execution scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, a case study in quantum chemistry shows that the C3-VQA reduces total heat dissipation by 87% with a 10,000-qubit system.

Some recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are proposed to reconstruct the thermal scenes in 3D from a set of thermal and RGB images. However, unlike NeRF, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) prevails due to its rapid training and real-time rendering. In this work, we propose ThermalGaussian, the first thermal 3DGS approach capable of rendering high-quality images in RGB and thermal modalities. We first calibrate the RGB camera and the thermal camera to ensure that both modalities are accurately aligned. Subsequently, we use the registered images to learn the multimodal 3D Gaussians. To prevent the overfitting of any single modality, we introduce several multimodal regularization constraints. We also develop smoothing constraints tailored to the physical characteristics of the thermal modality. Besides, we contribute a real-world dataset named RGBT-Scenes, captured by a hand-hold thermal-infrared camera, facilitating future research on thermal scene reconstruction. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that ThermalGaussian achieves photorealistic rendering of thermal images and improves the rendering quality of RGB images. With the proposed multimodal regularization constraints, we also reduced the model's storage cost by 90%. Our project page is at https://thermalgaussian.github.io/.

At-home testing solutions, known as home sleep apnea testing (HSAT), exist. However, they are contact-based, a feature which limits the ability of some patient populations to tolerate testing and discourages widespread deployment. Previous work on non-contact sleep monitoring for sleep apnea detection either estimates respiratory effort using radar or nasal airflow using a thermal camera, but has not compared the two or used them together. We conducted a study on 10 participants, ages 34 - 78, with suspected sleep disorders using a hardware setup with a synchronized radar and thermal camera. We show the first comparison of radar and thermal imaging for sleep monitoring, and find that our thermal imaging method outperforms radar significantly. Our thermal imaging method detects apneas with an accuracy of 0.99, a precision of 0.68, a recall of 0.74, an F1 score of 0.71, and an intra-class correlation of 0.70; our radar method detects apneas with an accuracy of 0.83, a precision of 0.13, a recall of 0.86, an F1 score of 0.22, and an intra-class correlation of 0.13. We also present a novel proposal for classifying obstructive and central sleep apnea by leveraging a multimodal setup. This method could be used accurately detect and classify apneas during sleep with non-contact sensors, thereby improving diagnostic capacities in patient populations unable to tolerate current technology.

To tackle this problem, we introduce \textbf{Co}nditional Dropout and \textbf{LA}nguage-driven(\textbf{CoLA}) framework comprising two core components. 1) Language-driven Quality Assessment (LQA): Leveraging a pretrained vision-language model with a prompt learner, the LQA recalibrates image contributions without requiring additional quality annotations. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of noisy inputs. 2) Conditional Dropout (CD): A learning method to strengthen the model's adaptability in scenarios with missing modalities, while preserving its performance under complete modalities. The CD serves as a plug-in training scheme that treats modality-missing as conditions, strengthening the overall robustness of various dual-modal SOD models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dual-modal SOD models, under both modality-complete and modality-missing conditions. We will release source code upon acceptance.

Using a mobile manipulator equipped with a flamethrower, we design a new system and algorithm to enable effective weed flaming, which requires robotic manipulation with a soft and deformable end effector, as the thermal coverage of the flame is affected by dynamic or unknown environmental factors such as gravity, wind, atmospheric pressure, fuel tank pressure, and pose of the nozzle. System development includes overall design, hardware integration, and software pipeline. To enable precise weed removal, the greatest challenge is to detect and predict dynamic flame coverage in real time before motion planning, which is quite different from a conventional rigid gripper in grasping or a spray gun in painting. Based on the images from two onboard infrared cameras and the pose information of the flamethrower nozzle on a mobile manipulator, we propose a new dynamic flame coverage model. The flame model uses a center-arc curve with a Gaussian cross-section model to describe the flame coverage in real time. The experiments have demonstrated the working system and shown that our model and algorithm can achieve a mean average precision (mAP) of more than 76\% in the reprojected images during online prediction.

The solvability analysis of the continuous and discrete problems is significantly more involved than usual as it hinges on Banach spaces needed to properly control the advective and dissipative terms in the non-isothermal energy balance equation. We proceed by decoupling the set of equations and use the Banach fixed-point theorem in combination with the abstract theory for perturbed saddle-point problems. Some of the necessary estimates are straightforward modifications of well-known results, while other technical tools require a more elaborated analysis. The velocity is approximated by Raviart--Thomas elements, the vorticity uses NÃ©dÃ©lec spaces of the first kind, the pressure is approximated by piecewise polynomials, and the temperature by continuous and piecewise polynomials of one degree higher than pressure. Special care is needed to establish discrete inf-sup conditions since the curl of the discrete vorticity is not necessarily contained in the discrete velocity space, therefore suggesting to use two different Raviart--Thomas interpolants. A discrete fixed-point argument is used to show well-posedness of the Galerkin scheme. Error estimates in appropriate norms are derived, and a few representative numerical examples in 2D and 3D and with mixed boundary conditions are provided.

However, most approaches to predictive air conditioning control either do not model indoor humidity or treat it as constant. This simplification stems from challenges with modeling indoor humidity dynamics, particularly the high-order, nonlinear equations that govern heat and mass transfer between the air conditioner's evaporator coil and the indoor air. This paper develops a machine-learning approach to modeling indoor humidity dynamics that is suitable for real-world deployment at scale. This study then investigates the value of humidity modeling in four field tests of predictive control in an occupied house. The four field tests evaluate two different building models: One with constant humidity and one with time-varying humidity. Each modeling approach is tested in two different predictive controllers: One that focuses on reducing energy costs and one that focuses on constraining electric power below a utility-specified threshold. The two models lead to similar performance for reducing energy costs. Combining the results of this study and a prior heating study of the same house, the estimated year-round energy cost savings were $340-497 or 22-31% (95% confidence intervals); these savings were consistent across both humidity models. However, in the demand response tests, the simplifying assumption of constant humidity led to far more frequent and severe violations of the power constraint. These results suggest that accurate building models are important for nonlinear objectives, such as reducing or constraining peak demand, while for linear objectives such as reducing energy costs or emissions, model accuracy is less important.

Operating at high temperatures these receivers face risks such as freezing, deformation, and corrosion, leading to operational failures, downtime, or costly equipment damage. We study the problem of anomaly detection (AD) in sequences of thermal images collected over a year from an operational CSP plant. These images are captured at irregular intervals ranging from one to five minutes throughout the day by infrared cameras mounted on solar receivers. Our goal is to develop a method to extract useful representations from high-dimensional thermal images for AD. It should be able to handle temporal features of the data, which include irregularity, temporal dependency between images and non-stationarity due to a strong daily seasonal pattern. The co-occurrence of low-temperature anomalies that resemble normal images from the start and the end of the operational cycle with high-temperature anomalies poses an additional challenge. We first evaluate state-of-the-art deep image-based AD methods, which have been shown to be effective in deriving meaningful image representations for the detection of anomalies. Then, we introduce a forecasting-based AD method that predicts future thermal images from past sequences and timestamps via a deep sequence model. This method effectively captures specific temporal data features and distinguishes between difficult-to-detect temperature-based anomalies. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to multiple SOTA baselines across multiple evaluation metrics. We have also successfully deployed our solution on five months of unseen data, providing critical insights for the maintenance of the CSP plant.

These methods aim to avoid issues such as accelerated aging of the device, premature failure and degraded chip performance. In this work, we implement a new TAS algorithm, VTF-TAS, which makes use of a variable temperature threshold to control task execution and thermal dissipation. To enable adequate execution of the tasks to reach their deadlines, this threshold is managed based on the theory of fluid scheduling. Using an evaluation methodology as described in POD-TAS, we evaluate VTF-TAS using a set of 4 benchmarks from the COMBS benchmark suite to examine its ability to minimize chip temperature throughout schedule execution. Through our evaluation, we demonstrate that this new algorithm is able to adaptively manage the temperature threshold such that the peak temperature during schedule execution is lower than POD-TAS, with no requirement for an expensive search procedure to obtain an optimal threshold for scheduling.

An ensemble POD-GP methodology (EnPOD-GP) is introduced to significantly improve the training effectiveness and prediction accuracy by dividing a large number of heat sources into heat source blocks (HSBs) each of which may contains one or a very small number of heat sources. Although very accurate, efficient and robust to any power map, EnPOD-GP suffers from intensive training for microprocessors with an enormous number of cores. A local-domain EnPOD-GP model (LEnPOD-GP) is thus proposed to further minimize the training burden. LEnPOD-GP utilizes the concepts of local domain truncation and generic building blocks to reduce the massive training data. LEnPOD-GP has been demonstrated on thermal simulation of NVIDIA Tesla Volta GV100, a GPU with more than 13,000 cores including FP32, FP64, INT32, and Tensor Cores. Due to the domain truncation for LEnPOD-GP, the least square error (LSE) is degraded but is still as small as 1.6% over the entire space and below 1.4% in the device layer when using 4 modes per HSB. When only the maximum temperature of the entire GPU is of interest, LEnPOD-GP offers a computing speed 1.1 million times faster than the FEM with a maximum error near 1.2 degrees over the entire simulation time.

Traditional RGB cameras struggle in such conditions, but thermal cameras can capture smoke-obscured flame features. However, they lack absolute thermal reference points, leading to false positives.To address this issue, FlameFinder utilizes paired thermal-RGB images for training. By learning latent flame features from smoke-free samples, the model becomes less biased towards relative thermal gradients. In testing, it identifies flames in smoky patches by analyzing their equivalent thermal-domain distribution. This method improves performance using both supervised and distance-based clustering metrics.The framework incorporates a flame segmentation method and a DML-aided detection framework. This includes utilizing center loss (CL), triplet center loss (TCL), and triplet cosine center loss (TCCL) to identify optimal cluster representatives for classification. However, the dominance of center loss over the other losses leads to the model missing features sensitive to them. To address this limitation, an attention mechanism is proposed. This mechanism allows for non-uniform feature contribution, amplifying the critical role of cosine and triplet loss in the DML framework. Additionally, it improves interpretability, class discrimination, and decreases intra-class variance. As a result, the proposed model surpasses the baseline by 4.4% in the FLAME2 dataset and 7% in the FLAME3 dataset for unobscured flame detection accuracy. Moreover, it demonstrates enhanced class separation in obscured scenarios compared to VGG19, ResNet18, and three backbone models tailored for flame detection.

During such unplanned outages, a house needs to be provided with an energy supply to maintain habitable conditions by maintaining thermal comfort and servicing at least critical loads. An energy system consisting of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) panels along with battery storage is an excellent carbon-free choice to provide energy resiliency to houses against extreme weather-related outages. However, to provide habitable conditions this energy system has to provide not only for the non-air-conditioning (non-AC) load demand but also for the turning on of the AC system which has a considerably higher startup power requirement as compared to its rated power. Hence, an intelligent automated decision-making controller is needed which can manage the trade-off between competing requirements.
  In this paper, we propose such an intelligent controller based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). We compare its performance with a Baseline controller which is unintelligent, and a Rule-Based controller which has some intelligence, based on three resiliency metrics that we have developed. We perform extensive simulations for numerous scenarios involving different energy system sizes and AC startup power requirements. Every simulation is one week long and is carried out for a single-family detached house located in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma in 2017. The simulation results show that the MPC controller performs better than the other controllers in the more energy-constrained scenarios (smaller PV-battery size, larger AC startup power requirement) in providing both thermal comfort and servicing non-AC loads in a balanced manner.

In particular, the proposed scheme exploits the inherent thermal dynamics of electromagnetic signals, enabling the seamless integration of information decoding and energy harvesting (EH). As a consequence, in contrast to conventional SWIPT techniques, the proposed model eliminates the need to divide the received signal into orthogonal components. By exploiting the thermal correlation between consecutive time slots, the communication channel is converted to a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with memory. We evaluate the achievable rate of the proposed temperature-modulated channel for uniform and exponential input distributions and assess its performance in terms of harvested energy through a non-linear harvesting model. Our numerical results reveal that the exponential distribution outperforms the uniform distribution in rate and harvested energy at low input power levels, while the uniform distribution achieves a better EH performance at high input power levels.

Previous approaches using RGB or NIR imagery struggle in challenging conditions: RGB methods are susceptible to lighting variations and obstructions like handwear, while NIR techniques can be disrupted by sunlight or interference from other NIR-equipped devices. To address these limitations, we present ThermoHands, the first benchmark focused on thermal image-based egocentric 3D hand pose estimation, demonstrating the potential of thermal imaging to achieve robust performance under these conditions. The benchmark includes a multi-view and multi-spectral dataset collected from 28 subjects performing hand-object and hand-virtual interactions under diverse scenarios, accurately annotated with 3D hand poses through an automated process. We introduce a new baseline method, TherFormer, utilizing dual transformer modules for effective egocentric 3D hand pose estimation in thermal imagery. Our experimental results highlight TherFormer's leading performance and affirm thermal imaging's effectiveness in enabling robust 3D hand pose estimation in adverse conditions.

These simulators can take device nonidealities into account and are integrated with modern ML frameworks. However, memristors in these simulators are modeled with either lookup tables or simple analytic models with basic nonlinearities. These simple models are unable to capture certain performance-critical aspects of device nonidealities. For example, they ignore the physical cause of switching, which induces errors in switching timings and thus incorrect estimations of conductance states. This work aims at bringing physical dynamics into consideration to model nonidealities while being compatible with GPU accelerators. We focus on Valence Change Memory (VCM) cells, where the switching nonlinearity and SET/RESET asymmetry relate tightly with the thermal resistance, ion mobility, Schottky barrier height, parasitic resistance, and other effects. The resulting dynamics require solving an ODE that captures changes in oxygen vacancies. We modified a physics-derived SPICE-level VCM model, integrated it with the aihwkit simulator and tested the performance with the MNIST dataset. Results show that noise that disrupts the SET/RESET matching affects network performance the most. This work serves as a tool for evaluating how physical dynamics in memristive devices affect neural network accuracy and can be used to guide the development of future integrated devices.

For block preconditioners this typically involves the factorisation of the (approximate) Jacobian resulting from linearization of the coupled system into a Helmholtz equation for some function of the pressure. Here we present a preconditioner for the compressible Euler equations with a flux form representation of the potential temperature on the Lorenz grid using mixed finite elements. This formulation allows for spatial discretisations that conserve both energy and potential temperature variance. By introducing the dry thermodynamic entropy as an auxiliary variable for the solution of the algebraic system, the resulting preconditioner is shown to have a similar block structure to an existing preconditioner for the material form transport of potential temperature on the Charney-Phillips grid. This new formulation is also shown to be more efficient and stable than both the material form transport of potential temperature on the Charney-Phillips grid, and a previous Helmholtz preconditioner for the flux form transport of density weighted potential temperature on the Lorenz grid for a 1D thermal bubble configuration. The new preconditioner is further verified against standard two dimensional test cases in a vertical slice geometry.

The mathematical model encompasses Darcy's law for incompressible fluid behavior, which is coupled with a convection-diffusion-type energy equation to characterize the temperature in the porous medium. The current investigation presents an efficient, stable, and accurate finite element discretization for the hydro-thermal convective flow model. The well-posedness of the proposed discrete Galerkin finite element formulation is guaranteed due to the decoupling property and the linearity of the numerical method. Computational experiments confirm the optimal convergence rates for a manufactured solution. Several numerical results are obtained for the variations of the hydraulic resistivity and thermal diffusivity. In the present study, the bottom wall is maintained at a constant higher hot temperature while side vertical walls are thermally insulated and the top wall is maintained at a constant cold temperature. Heat transfer rates at the heated bottom wall are presented in terms of local Nusselt number. A linear variation in hydraulic resistivity and a quadratic variation in thermal diffusivity show an increase in the heat transfer rate.

However, electric heat pumps can sharply increase electricity demand, causing high utility bills and stressing the power grid. Residential neighborhoods could see particularly high electricity demand during cold weather, when heat demand rises and heat pump efficiencies fall. This paper presents the development and field demonstration of a predictive control system for an air-to-air heat pump with backup electric resistance heat. The control system adjusts indoor temperature set-points based on weather forecasts, occupancy conditions, and data-driven models of the building and heating equipment. Field tests from January to March of 2023 in an occupied, all-electric, 208 m^2 detached single-family house in Indiana, USA, included outdoor temperatures as low as -15 C. On average over these tests, the control system reduced daily heating energy use by 19% (95% confidence interval: 13--24%), energy used for backup heat by 38%, and the frequency of using the highest stage (19 kW) of backup heat by 83%. Concurrent surveys of residents showed that the control system maintained satisfactory thermal comfort. The control system could reduce the house's total annual heating costs by about $300 (95% confidence interval: 23--34%). These real-world results could strengthen the case for deploying predictive home heating control, bringing the technology one step closer to reducing emissions, utility bills, and power grid impacts at scale.

In practical applications such as inertial confinement fusion, TRT is coupled to other physics such as hydrodynamics, plasmas, etc., and the timescales one is interested in capturing are often much slower than the radiation timescale. As a result, TRT is treated implicitly, and due to its stiffness and high dimensionality, is often a dominant computational cost in multiphysics simulations. Here we develop a new approach for implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration of gray TRT in the deterministic S$_N$ setting, which requires only one sweep per stage, with the simplest first-order method requiring only one sweep per time step. The partitioning of equations is done via a moment-based high-order low-order formulation of TRT, where the streaming operator and first two moments are used to capture the asymptotic stiff regimes of the streaming limit and diffusion limit. Absorption-reemission is treated explicitly, and although stiff, is sufficiently damped by the implicit solve that we achieve stable accurate time integration without incorporating the coupling of the high order and low order equations implicitly. Due to nonlinear coupling of the high-order and low-order equations through temperature-dependent opacities, to facilitate IMEX partitioning and higher-order methods, we use a semi-implicit integration approach amenable to nonlinear partitions. Results are demonstrated on thick Marshak and crooked pipe benchmark problems, demonstrating orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy and wallclock compared with the standard first-order implicit integration typically used.

The focus is on the steady-state heat equations within heterogeneous solids exhibiting significant phase contrast. Similar equations manifest in diverse applications like chemical diffusion, electrostatics, and Darcy flow. The neural network aims to establish the link between the complex thermal conductivity profiles and temperature distributions, as well as heat flux components within the microstructure, under fixed boundary conditions. A distinctive aspect is our independence from classical solvers like finite element methods for data. A noteworthy contribution lies in our novel approach to defining the loss function, based on the discretized weak form of the governing equation. This not only reduces the required order of derivatives but also eliminates the need for automatic differentiation in the construction of loss terms, accepting potential numerical errors from the chosen discretization method. As a result, the loss function in this work is an algebraic equation that significantly enhances training efficiency. We benchmark our methodology against the standard finite element method, demonstrating accurate yet faster predictions using the trained neural network for temperature and flux profiles. We also show higher accuracy by using the proposed method compared to purely data-driven approaches for unforeseen scenarios.

Recently, transformer-based methods have achieved significant performance in SISR. However, in the SR task, only a small number of pixels are involved in the transformers self-attention (SA) mechanism due to the computational complexity of the attention mechanism. The lambda abstraction is a promising alternative to SA in modeling long-range interactions while being computationally more efficient. This paper presents lambda abstraction-based thermal image super-resolution (LATIS), a novel lightweight architecture for SISR of thermal images. LATIS sequentially captures local and global information using the local and global feature block (LGFB). In LGFB, we introduce a global feature extraction (GFE) module based on the lambda abstraction mechanism, channel-shuffle and convolution (CSConv) layer to encode local context. Besides, to improve the performance further, we propose a differentiable patch-wise histogram-based loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that our LATIS, with the least model parameters and complexity, achieves better or comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets.

Accurate fall detection can help reduce potential injuries and additional health complications. Different types of video modalities can be used in a home setting to detect falls, including RGB, Infrared, and Thermal cameras. Anomaly detection frameworks using autoencoders and their variants can be used for fall detection due to the data imbalance that arises from the rarity and diversity of falls. However, the use of reconstruction error in autoencoders can limit the application of networks' structures that propagate information. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective loss function called Temporal Shift, which aims to predict both future and reconstructed frames within a window of sequential frames. The proposed loss function is evaluated on a semi-naturalistic fall detection dataset containing multiple camera modalities. The autoencoders were trained on normal activities of daily living (ADL) performed by older adults and tested on ADLs and falls performed by young adults. Temporal shift shows significant improvement to a baseline 3D Convolutional autoencoder, an attention U-Net CAE, and a multi-modal neural network. The greatest improvement was observed in an attention U-Net model improving by 0.20 AUC ROC for a single camera when compared to reconstruction alone. With significant improvement across different models, this approach has the potential to be widely adopted and improve anomaly detection capabilities in other settings besides fall detection.

Since human feels the temperature of the air without touching other objects, it is necessary to present thermal sensation in a non-contact manner. Studies on non-contact heat display have been explored; however, few studies have reported on a device that can display cold in a non-contact manner. In this study, we propose a non-contact cold thermal display using a low-temperature heat source-vortex tube, which can generate ultra-low air temperature when supplied with compressed air. We developed a cooling model that relates the flow velocity of cold air with the absorbed heat from skin; we implemented a prototype system that can control the flow velocity of the generated air; and we conducted an experiment to examine the cold sensation that the system can present. Our results revealed that various cold sensations can be generated so that the faster the flow velocity, the colder a user would feel.

Therefore, the development of thermal sensation presentation technologies holds significant potential, providing a novel method of interaction. Traditional technologies often leave residual heat in the system or the skin, affecting subsequent presentations. Our study focuses on presenting thermal sensations with low residual heat, especially cold sensations. To mitigate the impact of residual heat in the presentation system, we opted for a non-contact method, and to address the influence of residual heat on the skin, we present thermal sensations without significantly altering skin temperature. Specifically, we integrated two highly responsive and independent heat transfer mechanisms: convection via cold air and radiation via visible light, providing non-contact thermal stimuli. By rapidly alternating between perceptible decreases and imperceptible increases in temperature on the same skin area, we maintained near-constant skin temperature while presenting continuous cold sensations. In our experiments involving 15 participants, we observed that when the cooling rate was -0.2 to -0.24 degree celsius per second and the cooling time ratio was 30 to 50 %, more than 86.67 % of the participants perceived only persistent cold without any warmth.

The VEF model is a data-driven one that acts on known (a-priori) radiation-diffusion solutions for material temperatures in the TRT problem. A linear auxiliary problem is constructed for the radiative transfer equation (RTE) with opacities and emission source evaluated at the known material temperatures. The solution to this RTE approximates the specific intensity distribution for the problem in all phase-space and time. It is applied as a shape function to define the Eddington tensor for the presented VEF model. The shape function computed via the auxiliary RTE problem will capture some degree of transport effects within the TRT problem. The VEF moment equations closed with this approximate Eddington tensor will thus carry with them these captured transport effects. In this study, the temperature data comes from multigroup $P_1$, $P_{1/3}$, and flux-limited diffusion radiative transfer (RT) models. The proposed VEF model can be interpreted as a transport-corrected diffusion reduced-order model. Numerical results are presented on the Fleck-Cummings test problem which models a supersonic wavefront of radiation. The presented VEF model is shown to reliably improve accuracy by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the considered radiation-diffusion model solutions to the TRT problem.

The execution of these tasks leads to significant power dissipation and heating of the device. It therefore results in severe thermal issues like temperature escalation, high thermal gradients, and excessive hot spot formation, which may result in degrading chip performance, accelerating device aging, and premature failure. Thermal-Aware Scheduling (TAS) enables optimization of thermal dissipation to maintain a safe thermal state. In this work, we implement a new TAS algorithm, POD-TAS, which manages the thermal behavior of a multi-core CPU based on a defined set of states and their transitions. We compare the performances of a dynamic RC thermal circuit simulator (HotSpot) and a reduced order Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-based thermal model and we select the latter for use in our POD-TAS algorithm. We implement a novel simulation-based evaluation methodology to compare TAS algorithms. This methodology is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed POD-TAS algorithm. Additionally, we compare the performance of a state of the art TAS algorithm, RT-TAS, to our proposed POD-TAS algorithm. Furthermore, we utilize the COMBS benchmark suite to provide CPU workloads for task scheduling. Our experimental results on a multi-core processor using a set of 4 benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed POD-TAS method can improve thermal performance by decreasing the peak thermal variance by 53.0% and the peak chip temperature of 29.01%. Using a set of 8 benchmarks, the comparison of the two algorithms shows a decrease of 29.57% in the peak spatial variance of the chip temperature and 26.26% in the peak chip temperature. We also identify several potential future research directions.

However, existing methods neglect the characteristics of cross-modal features and rely solely on network structures to fuse RGB and thermal features. To address this, we first propose a Multi-Modal Hybrid loss (MMHL) that comprises supervised and self-supervised loss functions. The supervised loss component of MMHL distinctly utilizes semantic features from different modalities, while the self-supervised loss component reduces the distance between RGB and thermal features. We further consider both spatial and channel information during feature fusion and propose the Hybrid Fusion Module to effectively fuse RGB and thermal features. Lastly, instead of jointly training the network with cross-modal features, we implement a sequential training strategy which performs training only on RGB images in the first stage and then learns cross-modal features in the second stage. This training strategy improves saliency detection performance without computational overhead. Results from performance evaluation and ablation studies demonstrate the superior performance achieved by the proposed method compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Traditionally, large-scale thermal generation is needed to economically support the load demand of HVDC with a given profile, which in turn raises concerns about carbon emissions. To address the issues above, hydrogen energy storage system (HESS) and ammonia energy storage system (AESS) are introduced to gradually replace thermal generation, which is represented as a multi-stage expansion planning (MSEP) problem. Specifically, first, HESS and AESS are established in the MSEP model with carbon emission reduction constraints, and yearly data with hourly time resolution are utilized for each stage to well describe the intermittence of RES. Then, a combined Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition (DWD) and column generation (CG) solution approach is proposed to efficiently solve the large-scale MSEP model. Finally, a real-life system in China is studied. The results indicate that HESS and AESS have the potential to handle the intermittence of RES, as well as the monthly imbalance between RES and load demand. Especially under the goal of carbon neutrality, the contribution of HESS and AESS in reducing levelized cost of energy (LCOE) reaches 12.28% and 14.59%, respectively, which finally leads to a LCOE of 0.4324 RMB/kWh.

The TRT ROM is formulated by (i) a hierarchy of low-order quasidiffusion (aka variable Eddington factor) equations for moments of the radiation intensity and (ii) the normalized Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). The multilevel system of moment equations is derived by projection of the BTE onto a sequence of subspaces which represent elements of the phase space of the problem. Exact closure for the moment equations is provided by the Eddington tensor. A Petrov-Galerkin (PG) projection of the normalized BTE is formulated using a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) basis representing the normalized radiation intensity over the whole phase space and time. The Eddington tensor linearly depends on the solution of the normalized BTE. By linear superposition of the POD basis functions, a low-rank expansion of the Eddington tensor is constructed with coefficients defined by the PG projected normalized BTE. The material energy balance (MEB) equation is coupled with the effective grey low-order equations which exist on the same dimensional scale as the MEB equation. The resulting TRT ROM is structure and asymptotic preserving. A detailed analysis of the ROM is performed on the classical Fleck-Cummings (F-C) TRT multigroup test problem in 2D geometry. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the ROM's effectiveness in the simulation of radiation wave phenomena. The ROM is shown to produce solutions with sufficiently high accuracy while using low-rank approximation of the normalized BTE solution. Essential physical characteristics of supersonic radiation wave are preserved in the ROM solutions.

While radars and thermal cameras are known for their resilience to these conditions, few studies have been conducted on radar-thermal fusion due to the lack of corresponding datasets. To address this gap, we first present a new multi-modal dataset called ThermRad, which includes a 3D LiDAR, a 4D radar, an RGB camera and a thermal camera. This dataset is unique because it includes data from all four sensors in extreme weather conditions, providing a valuable resource for future research in this area. To validate the robustness of 4D radars and thermal cameras for 3D object detection in challenging weather conditions, we propose a new multi-modal fusion method called RTDF-RCNN, which leverages the complementary strengths of 4D radars and thermal cameras to boost object detection performance. To further prove the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we re-implement state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D detectors on our dataset as benchmarks for evaluation. Our method achieves significant enhancements in detecting cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, with improvements of over 7.98%, 24.27%, and 27.15%, respectively, while achieving comparable results to LiDAR-based approaches. Our contributions in both the ThermRad dataset and the new multi-modal fusion method provide a new approach to robust 3D object detection in adverse weather and illumination conditions. The ThermRad dataset will be released.

This apparent contradiction is known as the "arrow of time problem". Its current resolution states that the future is the direction of increasing entropy. But entropy can only increase towards the future if it was low in the past, and past low entropy is a very strong assumption to make, because low entropy states are rather improbable, non-generic. Recent works from the Physics literature suggest, however, we may do away with this so-called "past hypothesis", in the presence of reversible dynamical laws featuring expansion. We prove that this can be the case in principle, within a toy model. It consists in graphs upon which particles circulate and interact according to local reversible rules. Some rules locally shrink or expand the graph. We prove that almost all states expand; entropy always increases as a consequence of expansion -- thereby providing a local explanation for the rise of an entropic arrow of time without the need for a past hypothesis. The discrete setting of this toy model allows us to deploy the full rigour of theoretical Computer Science proof techniques. It also allows for the numerical exploration of several physically-motivated variants: a time-symmetric variant; two inflationary variants; and a damping variant -- which slows down thermal death. The fact that all of these models exhibit similar behaviours suggests that local reversible expansion mechanisms constitute a robust recipe for a time arrow without past hypothesis. In this qualitative sense, the explanation may therefore also be relevant at the cosmological level.

These receivers are composed by a large number of parallel pipes with the same geometry. We have introduced a reduced Schwarz algorithm that skips the computation in a large part of the pipes. The computation of the temperature in the skep domain is replaced by a reduced mapping that provides the transmission conditions. This reduced mapping is computed in an off-line stage. We have performed an error analysis of the reduced Schwarz algorithm, proving that the error is bounded in terms of the linearly decreasing error of the standard Schwarz algorithm, plus the error stemming from the reduction of the trace mapping. The last error is asymptotically dominant in the Schwarz iterative process. We obtain $L^2$ errors below $2\%$ with relatively small overlapping lengths.

The method is formulated with a multilevel set of moment equations of the BTE which are coupled to the material energy balance (MEB). The moment equations are exactly closed via the Eddington tensor defined by the BTE solution. Two discrete spatial meshes are defined: a material grid on which the MEB and low-order moment equations are discretized, and a grid of characteristics for solving the BTE. Numerical testing of the method is completed on the well-known Fleck-Cummings test problem which models a supersonic radiation wave propagation. Mesh refinement studies are performed on each of the two spatial grids independently, holding one mesh width constant while refining the other. We also present the data on convergence of iterations.

Fully implicit temporal discretization based on the backward Euler time-integration method is used for all equations. The multilevel iterative scheme is designed to perform iteration cycles over collections of multiple time steps, each of which can be interpreted as a coarse time interval with a subgrid of time steps. This treatment is demonstrated to transform implicit temporal integrators to diagonally-implicit multi-step schemes on the coarse time grid formed with the amalgamated time intervals. A multilevel set of moment equations are formulated by the nonlinear projective approach. The Eddington tensor defined with the BTE solution provides exact closure for the moment equations. During each iteration, a number of chronological time steps are solved with the BTE alone, after which the same collection of time steps is solved with the moment equations and material energy balance. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this iterative scheme for simulating evolving radiation and heat waves in 2D geometry.

We maximize power output of the thermodynamic engine at steady-state and show that the optimal reactive force is precise half of that supplied by the anisotropy.

Super-resolution clarifies, sharpens, and upscales an image to higher resolution. Applications such as gaming and video playback along with the ever-improving display capabilities of TVs, smartphones, and VR headsets are driving the need for efficient upscaling solutions. While existing deep learning-based super-resolution approaches achieve impressive results in terms of visual quality, enabling real-time DL-based super-resolution on mobile devices with compute, thermal, and power constraints is challenging. To address these challenges, we propose QuickSRNet, a simple yet effective architecture that provides better accuracy-to-latency trade-offs than existing neural architectures for single-image super resolution. We present training tricks to speed up existing residual-based super-resolution architectures while maintaining robustness to quantization.

We utilize Bussgang decomposition to derive the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimates at each BS based on the quantized received uplink training signals, and the asymptotic closed-form expressions of the achievable downlink rates under one-bit quantized zero-forcing (ZF) precoding implemented using the estimated channels. The derived expressions explicitly show the impact of quantization noise, thermal noise, pilot contamination, and interference, and are utilized to study the number of additional antennas needed at each BS of the one-bit MIMO system to perform as well as the conventional MIMO system. Numerical results verify our analysis, and reveal that despite needing more antennas to achieve the same sum average rate, the one-bit massive MIMO system is more energy-efficient than the conventional system, especially at high sampling frequencies.

Clinical ultrasound often assumes a constant sound speed to form B-mode images for diagnosis. However, the various types of breast tissue, such as glandular, fat, and lesions, differ in sound speed. These differences can degrade the image reconstruction process. Alternatively, sound speed can be a powerful tool for identifying disease. To this end, we propose a deep-learning approach for sound speed estimation from in-phase and quadrature ultrasound signals. First, we develop a large-scale simulated ultrasound dataset that generates quasi-realistic breast tissue by modeling breast gland, skin, and lesions with varying echogenicity and sound speed. We developed a fully convolutional neural network architecture trained on a simulated dataset to produce an estimated sound speed map from inputting three complex-value in-phase and quadrature ultrasound images formed from plane-wave transmissions at separate angles. Furthermore, thermal noise augmentation is used during model optimization to enhance generalizability to real ultrasound data. We evaluate the model on simulated, phantom, and in-vivo breast ultrasound data, demonstrating its ability to accurately estimate sound speeds consistent with previously reported values in the literature. Our simulated dataset and model will be publicly available to provide a step towards accurate and generalizable sound speed estimation for pulse-echo ultrasound imaging.

However, due to the low compliance and quality of hand hygiene reported in previous studies, constant monitoring of healthcare workers' hand hygiene compliance and quality is crucial. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using a thermal camera together with an RGB camera to detect hand coverage of alcohol-based formulation, thereby monitoring handrub quality. The system yields promising results in terms of accuracy (93.5%) and Dice coefficient (87.1%) when observations take place 10 seconds after performing handrub. In addition, we also examine the system performance change over a 60-second observation period, and the accuracy and Dice coefficient still remain at about 92.4% and 85.7% when observation happens at the 60-second time point. Given these encouraging results, thermal imaging shows its potential feasibility in providing accurate, constant, and systematic hand hygiene quality monitoring.

While physically sound, classical gray-box models are often cumbersome to identify and scale, and their accuracy might be hindered by their limited expressiveness. On the other hand, classical black-box methods, typically relying on Neural Networks (NNs) nowadays, often achieve impressive performance, even at scale, by deriving statistical patterns from data. However, they remain completely oblivious to the underlying physical laws, which may lead to potentially catastrophic failures if decisions for real-world physical systems are based on them. Physically Consistent Neural Networks (PCNNs) were recently developed to address these aforementioned issues, ensuring physical consistency while still leveraging NNs to attain state-of-the-art accuracy.
  In this work, we scale PCNNs to model building temperature dynamics and propose a thorough comparison with classical gray-box and black-box methods. More precisely, we design three distinct PCNN extensions, thereby exemplifying the modularity and flexibility of the architecture, and formally prove their physical consistency. In the presented case study, PCNNs are shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, even outperforming classical NN-based models despite their constrained structure. Our investigations furthermore provide a clear illustration of NNs achieving seemingly good performance while remaining completely physics-agnostic, which can be misleading in practice. While this performance comes at the cost of computational complexity, PCNNs on the other hand show accuracy improvements of 17-35% compared to all other physically consistent methods, paving the way for scalable physically consistent models with state-of-the-art performance.

Part I: The one-dimensional case</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>In this paper, we develop a fully conservative, positivity-preserving, and entropy-bounded discontinuous Galerkin scheme for simulating the chemically reacting, compressible Euler equations with complex thermodynamics. The proposed formulation is an extension of the conservative, high-order numerical method previously developed by Johnson and Kercher [J. Comput. Phys., 423 (2020), 109826] that maintains pressure equilibrium between adjacent elements. In this first part of our two-part paper, we focus on the one-dimensional case. Our methodology is rooted in the minimum entropy principle satisfied by entropy solutions to the multicomponent, compressible Euler equations, which was proved by Gouasmi et al. [ESAIM: Math. Model. Numer. Anal., 54 (2020), 373--389] for nonreacting flows. We first show that the minimum entropy principle holds in the reacting case as well. Next, we introduce the ingredients required for the solution to have nonnegative species concentrations, positive density, positive pressure, and bounded entropy. We also discuss how to retain the aforementioned ability to preserve pressure equilibrium between elements. Operator splitting is employed to handle stiff chemical reactions. To guarantee satisfaction of the minimum entropy principle in the reaction step, we develop an entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin method based on diagonal-norm summation-by-parts operators for solving ordinary differential equations. The developed formulation is used to compute canonical one-dimensional test cases, namely thermal-bubble advection, multicomponent shock-tube flow, and a moving hydrogen-oxygen detonation wave with detailed chemistry. We find that the enforcement of an entropy bound can considerably reduce the large-scale nonlinear instabilities that emerge when only the positivity property is enforced, to an even greater extent than in the monocomponent, calorically perfect case.

Most existing methods use boundary maps to learn the sharp boundary. These methods ignore the interactions between isolated boundary pixels and other confident pixels, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this problem,we propose a position-aware relation learning network (PRLNet) for RGB-T SOD based on swin transformer. PRLNet explores the distance and direction relationships between pixels to strengthen intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, generating salient object masks with clear boundaries and homogeneous regions. Specifically, we develop a novel signed distance map auxiliary module (SDMAM) to improve encoder feature representation, which takes into account the distance relation of different pixels in boundary neighborhoods. Then, we design a feature refinement approach with directional field (FRDF), which rectifies features of boundary neighborhood by exploiting the features inside salient objects. FRDF utilizes the directional information between object pixels to effectively enhance the intra-class compactness of salient regions. In addition, we constitute a pure transformer encoder-decoder network to enhance multispectral feature representation for RGB-T SOD. Finally, we conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on three public benchmark datasets.The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, we develop a control design framework for this class of system with both safety and stability guarantees based on control Lyapunov functional and control barrier functional. To illustrate our methodology, we apply our strategy to design a thermal control system for battery modules under disturbance. Several simulation studies are done to show the efficacy of our method.

They are formulated by means of the nonlinear projective approach and data compression techniques. The nonlinear projection is applied to the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to derive a hierarchy of low-order moment equations. The Eddington (quasidiffusion) tensor that provides exact closure for the system of moment equations is approximated via one of several data-based methods of model-order reduction. These methods are the (i) proper orthogonal decomposition, (ii) dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), (iii) an equilibrium-subtracted DMD variant. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of these ROMs for the simulation of evolving radiation and heat waves. Results show these models to be accurate even with very low-rank representations of the Eddington tensor. As the rank of the approximation is increased, the errors of solutions generated by the ROMs gradually decreases.

While model predictive control (MPC) is an attractive control strategy for many systems, embedding it within a CCD algorithm presents challenges because obtaining a closed-form solution for this receding-horizon optimization strategy is often not feasible. This paper meets that challenge by including a robust MPC formulation within the inner loop of a CCD algorithm. As exemplified by application to an aircraft thermal management system, the proposed algorithm closely matches the plant design of an open-loop benchmark. However, unlike the open-loop approach, the proposed algorithm can leverage MPC control variables designed a priori to achieve robust online operation under disturbance profiles that differ from those used for design.

A conventional approach is to add safety margins to a design that was obtained from deterministic optimization. Safer engineering designs require appropriate cost and constraint function definitions that capture the \textit{risk} associated with unwanted system behavior in the presence of uncertainties. The paper proposes two notions of certifiability. The first is based on accounting for the magnitude of failure to ensure data-informed conservativeness. The second is the ability to provide optimization convergence guarantees by preserving convexity. Satisfying these notions leads to \textit{certifiable} risk-based design optimization (CRiBDO). In the context of CRiBDO, risk measures based on superquantile (a.k.a.\ conditional value-at-risk) and buffered probability of failure are analyzed. CRiBDO is contrasted with reliability-based design optimization (RBDO), where uncertainties are accounted for via the probability of failure, through a structural and a thermal design problem. A reformulation of the short column structural design problem leading to a convex CRiBDO problem is presented. The CRiBDO formulations capture more information about the problem to assign the appropriate conservativeness, exhibit superior optimization convergence by preserving properties of underlying functions, and alleviate the adverse effects of choosing hard failure thresholds required in RBDO.

The use of the Laguerre transform in time leads to a sequence of stationary inverse problems. Then, the application of the modified single-layer ansatz, reduces the problem to a sequence of systems of non-linear boundary integral equations. An iterative algorithm is developed for the numerical solution of the obtained integral equations. We find the FrÃ©chet derivative of the corresponding integral operator and we show the unique solvability of the linearized equation. Full discretization is realized by a trigonometric quadrature method. Due to the inherited ill-possedness of the derived system of linear equations we apply the Tikhonov regularization.

A reformulated two-stage robust optimization approach is introduced to account for multiple uncertainties, including electricity prices, non-dispatchable renewable energy sources electrical production, CSP thermal production, and uncertainties in electrical and thermal demand consumption. The provision of energy and reserve by the thermal storage of CSP is modeled using an adjustable approach, which allocates a share of energy for up and down reserves based on the profitability of the RVPP. Simulations are conducted for several case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach under different RVPP operator decisions against uncertain parameters and various trading strategies for electricity and thermal energy. The simulation results show that integrating CSP into RVPP enhances RVPP flexibility for both electrical and thermal trading. Furthermore, the results indicate that the profitability of the RVPP increases when all trading options are considered, across different levels of conservatism adopted by the RVPP operator in response to uncertain parameters.

Recent methods for image restoration either rely on data-driven priors that are susceptible to hallucinations, or are limited to static low-density smoke. We introduce SmokeSeer, a method for simultaneous 3D scene reconstruction and smoke removal from a video capturing multiple views of a scene. Our method uses thermal and RGB images, leveraging the fact that the reduced scattering in thermal images enables us to see through the smoke. We build upon 3D Gaussian splatting to fuse information from the two image modalities, and decompose the scene explicitly into smoke and non-smoke components. Unlike prior approaches, SmokeSeer handles a broad range of smoke densities and can adapt to temporally varying smoke. We validate our approach on synthetic data and introduce a real-world multi-view smoke dataset with RGB and thermal images. We provide open-source code and data at the project website.

Fiber simulations, also called digital twins, provide a basis for testing and optimizing the material's physical behavior digitally. Inter-fiber contacts can influence the thermal and mechanical behavior of a fiber system; to our knowledge, however, there exist no parametric fiber models allowing for explicit modeling of the number of inter-fiber contacts. Therefore, this paper proposes an extension of the iterative force-biased fiber packing by Altendorf \& Jeulin. In this extension, we model the inter-fiber contacts explicitly and add another force to the force-biased packing to increase the number of contacts. We successfully validate the packing with respect to its parameter accuracy. Moreover, we show that the extension indeed increases the number of contacts, even exceeding theoretical values. Hence, this packing scheme has the potential to achieve higher accuracy in physical simulations.

In application, an ATES keeps large quantities of thermal energy in groundwater-saturated aquifers. Normally, an ATES system comprises two (one for heat and one for cold) storages and supports the heating and cooling efforts of simultaneously present HVAC system components. This way, the operation and emissions of installed and, usually, fossil fuel-based components are reduced. The control of ATES systems is challenging, and various control schemes, including model predictive control (MPC), have been proposed. In this context, we present a lightweight input-output-data-based autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model of the hybrid ATES system dynamics. The ARX model allows the design of an output-based MPC scheme, resulting in an easy-to-solve quadratic program and avoiding challenging state estimations of ground temperatures. A numerical study discusses the accuracy of the ARX predictor and controller performance.

Use cases for such a capability include: cloud avoidance, storm hunting, search for planetary boundary layer events, plume study, and beyond. The DT concept requires a lookahead sensor or agility to use a primary sensor in such a mode, edge computing to analyze images rapidly onboard, and a primary followup sensor. Additionally, an inter-satellite or low latency communications link can be leveraged for cross platform tasking.

However, reliable defect detection requires high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model, using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal defects.

Traditional RGB-based detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and naïve fusion strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

However, thermal cameras encounter challenges when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Therefore, many new TL research areas emerge in the field, such as selecting the right source model for TL.

Neither public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of TL research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building simulation. We present BuilDa, a thermal building data generation framework for producing synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for TL research. The framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for pretraining and fine-tuning TL models.

As these models are increasingly deployed in shared Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) environments via Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), concerns around their security grow. In particular, the risk of side-channel attacks that reveal architectural details without physical access remains underexplored, despite the high value of the proprietary models they target. This work to the best of our knowledge is the first to investigate GPU power and thermal fluctuations as side-channels and further exploit them to extract information from pre-trained transformer models. The proposed analysis shows how these side channels can be exploited at user-privilege to reveal critical architectural details such as encoder/decoder layer and attention head for both language and vision transformers. We demonstrate the practical impact by evaluating multiple language and vision pre-trained transformers which are publicly available. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that the attack model achieves a high accuracy of over 89% on average for model family identification and 100% for hyperparameter classification, in both single-process as well as noisy multi-process scenarios. Moreover, by leveraging the extracted architectural information, we demonstrate highly effective black-box transfer adversarial attacks with an average success rate exceeding 93%, underscoring the security risks posed by GPU side-channel leakage in deployed transformer models.

Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention head).

We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's multilayer architecture.

The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with deviations of a few percent from the exact value.

While this issue can be mitigated at the cell level using constant current-constant voltage (CCCV) charging, it is impractical at the pack level in large-scale systems. However, battery management systems and inverter controls can emulate this effect by tapering charging power at high state-of-charge (SOC) levels, trading off charging speed for improved efficiency and reduced thermal stress. Ignoring this behavior in planning models can lead to undersized batteries and potential reliability issues. This paper proposes a tractable and scalable approach to approximate CCCV behavior using SOC-dependent tapered charging power (TCP) constraints. A MATLAB-based proof of concept demonstrates the energy delivery and efficiency benefits of tapering. The method is integrated into a long-term planning framework and evaluated under a synthetic load and solar profile. Results show tapering significantly affects BESS sizing, cost, and reliability under dynamic operating conditions that demand fast charging. These findings highlight tapering as a critical modeling factor for accurately capturing BESS performance in long-term microgrid planning.

As these systems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict their states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control decisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior. Modern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges for modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state forecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor networks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate information across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are designed under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are typically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts their ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly encountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy conversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both homogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among sensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical - which exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on average by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its effectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.

This study presents an efficient modeling framework termed FEA-Regulated Physics-Informed Neural Network (FEA-PINN) to accelerate the thermal field prediction in a LPBF process while maintaining the FEA accuracy. A novel dynamic material updating strategy is developed to capture the dynamic phase change of powder-liquid-solid in the PINN model. The PINN model incorporates temperature-dependent material properties and phase change behavior using the apparent heat capacity method. While the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy with a small training data and enables generalization of new process parameters via transfer learning, it faces the challenge of high computation cost in time-dependent problems due to the residual accumulation. To overcome this issue, the FEA-PINN framework integrates corrective FEA simulations during inference to enforce physical consistency and reduce error drift. A comparative analysis shows that FEA-PINN achieves equivalent accuracy to FEA while significantly reducing computational cost. The framework has been validated using the benchmark FEA data and demonstrated through single-track scanning in LPBF.

This paper introduces a novel framework based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable, parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model (CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states, particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation. Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states. Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its potential as a robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation in realistic CV quantum systems.

Second, we show how our hand can distinguish objects with identical appearance but different masses - a capability beyond methods that use vision only.

As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet, and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.

This paper proposes an image fusion method based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs, and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics, producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich information without the necessity for a training dataset.

We show that a $\textit{square root law}$ (SRL) for covert entanglement generation similar to that for classical: $L_{\rm EG}\sqrt{n}$ entangled bits (ebits) can be generated covertly and reliably over $n$ uses of a bosonic channel. We report a single-letter expression for optimal $L_{\rm EG}$ as well as an achievable method. We additionally analyze the performance of covert entanglement generation using single- and dual-rail photonic qubits, which may be more practical for physical implementation.

However, their high power consumption, combined with avionics safety standards, brings new thermal management challenges. This paper investigates techniques for offline thermal-aware allocation of periodic tasks on heterogeneous MPSoCs running at a fixed clock frequency, as required in avionics. The goal is to find the assignment of tasks to (i) cores and (ii) temporal isolation windows while minimizing the MPSoC temperature. To achieve that, we propose and analyze three power models, and integrate them within several novel optimization approaches based on heuristics, a black-box optimizer, and Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We perform the experimental evaluation on three popular MPSoC platforms (NXP i.MX8QM MEK, NXP i.MX8QM Ixora, NVIDIA TX2) and observe a difference of up to 5.5Â°C among the tested methods (corresponding to a 22% reduction w.r.t. the ambient temperature). We also show that our method, integrating the empirical power model with the ILP, outperforms the other methods on all tested platforms.

The model uses a compatible finite element spatial discretisation, achieving good linear wave dispersion properties without spurious computational modes. A convergence test confirms the model's high temporal accuracy. Arbitrarily high spatial-temporal convergence is demonstrated using a gravity wave test case.

This paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired Optimizer), a novel neural optimizer inspired by kinetic theory and partial differential equation (PDE) simulations. We reimagine the training dynamics of network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic principles, where parameter updates are simulated via a numerical scheme for the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) that models stochastic particle collisions. This physics-driven approach inherently promotes parameter diversity during optimization, mitigating the phenomenon of parameter condensation, i.e. collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional subspaces, through mechanisms analogous to thermal diffusion in physical systems. We analyze this property, establishing both a mathematical proof and a physical interpretation. Extensive experiments on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and text classification (IMDB, Snips) tasks demonstrate that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD), achieving accuracy improvements while computation cost remains comparable.

However, perception systems still face challenges in complex real-world scenarios. To improve robustness against various external factors, multi-sensor fusion techniques are essential, combining the strengths of different sensor modalities. With recent developments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X communication, sensor fusion can now extend beyond a single vehicle to a cooperative multi-agent system involving Connected Automated Vehicle (CAV) and intelligent infrastructure. This paper presents VALISENS, an innovative multi-sensor system distributed across multiple agents. It integrates onboard and roadside LiDARs, radars, thermal cameras, and RGB cameras to enhance situational awareness and support cooperative automated driving. The thermal camera adds critical redundancy for perceiving Vulnerable Road User (VRU), while fusion with roadside sensors mitigates visual occlusions and extends the perception range beyond the limits of individual vehicles. We introduce the corresponding perception module built on this sensor system, which includes object detection, tracking, motion forecasting, and high-level data fusion. The proposed system demonstrates the potential of cooperative perception in real-world test environments and lays the groundwork for future Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) applications.

Combining two ATES, one can harness excess thermal energy from summer (heat) and winter (cold) to support the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) technology. In general, a dynamic operation of ATES throughout the year is beneficial to avoid using fossil fuel-based HVAC technology and maximize the ``green use'' of ATES. Model predictive control (MPC) with an appropriate system model may become a crucial control approach for ATES systems. Consequently, the MPC model should reflect spatial temperature profiles around ATES' boreholes to predict extracted groundwater temperatures accurately. However, meaningful predictions require the estimation of the current state of the system, as measurements are usually only at the borehole of the ATES. In control, this is often realized by model-based observers. Still, observing the state of an ATES system is non-trivial, since the model is typically hybrid. We show how to exploit the specific structure of the hybrid ATES model and design an easy-to-solve moving horizon estimator based on a quadratic program.

Nevertheless, in the most of the cases, the grasping and manipulation actions involve low to moderate payload and interaction forces. This is due to limitations often presented by the end-effectors, which can not match their arm-reachable payload, and hence limit the payload that can be grasped and manipulated. In addition, grippers usually do not embed adequate perception in their hardware, and grasping actions are mainly driven by perception sensors installed in the rest of the robot body, frequently affected by occlusions due to the arm motions during the execution of the grasping and manipulation tasks. To address the above, we developed a modular high grasping force gripper equipped with embedded multi-modal perception functionalities. The proposed gripper can generate a grasping force of 110 N in a compact implementation. The high grasping force capability is combined with embedded multi-modal sensing, which includes an eye-in-hand camera, a Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensor, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and an omnidirectional microphone, permitting the implementation of perception-driven grasping functionalities.
  We extensively evaluated the grasping force capacity of the gripper by introducing novel payload evaluation metrics that are a function of the robot arm's dynamic motion and gripper thermal states. We also evaluated the embedded multi-modal sensing by performing perception-guided enhanced grasping operations.

However, excessive size reduction in counterflow cHEXs can compromise effectiveness due to axial heat conduction through the solid material, influenced by thermal conductivity and wall thickness. This study investigates how AM material selection and thin-wall production limitations might constrain the core size of counterflow plate heat exchangers when targeting maximum power density. An optimization framework evaluates power densities for six materials: plastic, austenitic steel, Al2O3, AlN, aluminum, and copper. Evaluations are conducted under constant effectiveness and pressure drop while accounting for AM-specific plate thickness limits and a lower bound on plate spacing to address fouling. Across all scenarios, copper cHEXs exhibit the lowest power density, despite high thermal conductivity. Without constraints on plate thickness and spacing, the optimal plastic cHEX achieves a power density 1800x greater than the steel baseline, while copper decreases by a factor of 0.98. With equal plate thickness of 0.5 mm for all materials, plastic retains the highest power density, 12.2x more than copper. Introducing a fouling constraint of 0.8 mm plate spacing shifts the optimal material to austenitic steel. When material-specific plate thicknesses are considered, the plastic cHEX achieves the highest power density, five times greater than copper, due to superior thin-wall resolution. This study highlights the impact of AM constraints on the energy and material efficiency of cHEXs, and shows that low-conductivity materials like plastic or austenitic steel can outperform high-conductivity materials like copper in compact designs.

Therefore, a multi-modal haptic interface that provides various haptic signals simultaneously is highly beneficial. This paper introduces a novel silicone fingertip actuator that is pneumatically actuated, delivering a realistic and effective haptic experience by simultaneously providing pressure, vibrotactile, and cold thermal feedback. The actuator features a design with multiple air chambers, each with controllable volume achieved through pneumatic valves connected to compressed air tanks. The lower air chamber generates pressure feedback, while the upper chamber produces vibrotactile feedback. In addition, two integrated lateral air nozzles create a cold thermal sensation. To showcase the system's capabilities, we designed two unique 3D surfaces in the virtual environment: a frozen meat surface and an abrasive icy surface. These surfaces simulate tactile perceptions of coldness, pressure, and texture. Comprehensive performance assessments and user studies were conducted to validate the actuator's effectiveness, highlighting its diverse feedback capabilities compared to traditional actuators that offer only single feedback modalities.

Mean Radiant Temperature ($T_{mrt}$) is a key parameter for evaluating outdoor thermal comfort, especially in urban environments where radiation dynamics significantly impact human thermal exposure. Traditional methods of estimating $T_{mrt}$ rely on field measurements and computational simulations, both of which are resource intensive. This study introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach that integrates shortwave and longwave radiation modeling with deep learning techniques. By leveraging a multimodal dataset that includes meteorological data, built environment characteristics, and fisheye image-derived shading information, our model enhances predictive accuracy while maintaining physical consistency. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PINN framework outperforms conventional deep learning models, with the best-performing configurations achieving an RMSE of 3.50 and an $R^2$ of 0.88. This approach highlights the potential of physics-informed machine learning in bridging the gap between computational modeling and real-world applications, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for urban thermal comfort assessments.

These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.

However, in outdoor conditions typical in agricultural remote sensing, cameras based on UC-FPAs may suffer from drift in offset and gain. To tackle the persistent drift, the system requires continuous calibration. Our goal in this study was to eliminate this requirement via a computational schema. In a former study, we estimated unknown gain and offset values and thermographic images of an object from a sequence of pairs of successive images taken at two different blur levels.In the current work, we took on a similar problem using a sequence of shifted images, with relative shifts caused by realistic drone hovering modeled by homography transformation. This places our work in the realm of scene-based nonuniformity correction problems. We show that an object's thermographic values, as well as gain and offset, can be jointly estimated by relying on a few sets of shifted images. We use a minimum likelihood estimator, which is found using alternating minimization. Registration is done using a generalized Lucas-Kanade method. Simulations show promising accuracy with mean Pearson correlation of more than 0.9999998 between ground truth and restoration. Under ideal assumptions, this is equivalent to a mean restoration error of less than 0.01 Celsius degree.

This classical concept assumes the validity of Fourier's law, which states the heat flux is proportional to temperature gradient, with heat conductivity used to denote this ratio. However, this macroscopic constitutive relation breaks down at nano-scales. Instead, heat is propagated using phonon transport equation, an ab initio model derived from the first principle. In this equation, a material's thermal property is coded in a coefficient termed the relaxation time ($Ï$). We study an inverse problem in this paper, by using material's temperature response upon heat injection to infer the relaxation time. This inverse problem is formulated in a PDE-constrained optimization, and numerically solved by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method and its variants. In the execution of SGD, FrÃ©chet derivative is computed and Lipschitz continuity is proved. This approach, in comparison to the earlier studies, honors the nano-structure of of heat conductivity in a nano-material, and we numerically verify the break down of the Fourier's law.

This is particularly compelling for Global South and other underdeveloped regions, where reliable energy storage is vital to addressing critical challenges posed by weak and even nonexistent power grid and energy infrastructures. However, despite this potential, widespread adoption has been hindered by critical uncertainties surrounding the technical performance, safety, and recertification of second-life batteries. In cases where they have been redeployed, mismatches between estimated and actual performance often render batteries technically unsuitable or hazardous, turning them into liabilities for communities they were intended to benefit. This considerable misalignment exacerbates energy access disparities and undermines the broader vision of energy justice, highlighting an urgent need for robust and scalable solutions to unlock the potential. In the PulseBat Dataset, the authors tested 464 retired lithium-ion batteries, covering 3 cathode material types, 6 historical usages, 3 physical formats, and 6 capacity designs. The pulse test experiments were performed repeatedly for each second-life battery with 10 pulse width, 10 pulse magnitude, multiple state-of-charge, and state-of-health conditions, e.g., from 0.37 to 1.03. The PulseBat Dataset recorded these test conditions and the voltage response as well as the temperature signals that were subject to the injected pulse current, which could be used as a valuable data resource for critical diagnostics tasks such as state-of-charge estimation, state-of-health estimation, cathode material type identification, open-circuit voltage reconstruction, thermal management, and beyond.

However, their growing power demands pose significant challenges, particularly as systems scale to the exascale level. Prior uncore frequency tuning studies have primarily focused on conventional HPC workloads running on homogeneous systems. As HPC advances toward heterogeneous computing, integrating diverse GPU workloads on heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems, it is crucial to revisit and enhance uncore scaling. Our investigation reveals that uncore frequency scales down only when CPU power approaches its TDP (Thermal Design Power), an uncommon scenario in GPU-dominant applications, resulting in unnecessary power waste in modern heterogeneous computing systems. To address this, we present MAGUS, a user-transparent uncore frequency scaling runtime for heterogeneous computing. Effective uncore tuning is inherently complex, requiring dynamic detection of application execution phases that affect uncore utilization. Moreover, any robust strategy must work across a diverse range of applications, each with unique behaviors and resource requirements. Finally, an efficient runtime should introduce minimal overhead. We incorporate several key techniques in the design of MAGUS, including monitoring and predicting memory throughput, managing frequent phase transitions, and leveraging vendor-supplied power management support. We evaluate MAGUS using a diverse set of GPU benchmarks and applications across multiple heterogeneous systems with different CPU and GPU architectures. The experimental results show that MAGUS achieves up to 27% energy savings and 26% energy-delay product (EDP) reduction compared to the default settings while maintaining a performance loss below 5% and an overhead under 1%.

To apply heat locally, iron oxide nanoparticles are injected into the bloodstream and accumulate at the tumour site, where they generate heat when exposed to an alternating magnetic field. However, the temperature must be precisely controlled to achieve therapeutic benefits while avoiding damage to healthy tissue. We therefore present a computational model for nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia treatment fully integrated into a multiphase porous-media model of the tumour and its microenvironment. We study how the temperature depends on the amount of nanoparticles accumulated in the tumour area and the specific absorption rate of the nanoparticles. Our results show that host tissue surrounding the tumour is also exposed to considerable doses of heat due to the high thermal conductivity of the tissue, which may cause pain or even unnecessary irreversible damage. Further, we include a lumped and a discrete model for the cooling effect of blood perfusion. Using a discrete model of a realistic microvasculature reveals that the small capillaries do not have a significant cooling effect during hyperthermia treatment and that the commonly used lumped model based on Pennes' bioheat equation overestimates the effect: within the specific conditions analysed, the difference between lumped and discrete approaches is approximatively 0.75Â°C, which could influence the therapeutic intervention outcome. Such a comprehensive computational model, as presented here, can provide insights into the optimal treatment parameters for nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia and can be used to design more efficient treatment strategies.

We generalize our recent semi-implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration framework for gray TRT to multifrequency TRT, and also introduce a semi-implicit variation that facilitates higher-order integration of TRT, where each stage is implicit in all components except opacities. To appeal to the broad literature on adaptivity with Runge--Kutta methods, we derive new embedded methods for four asymptotic preserving IMEX Runge--Kutta schemes we have found to be robust in our previous work on TRT and radiation hydrodynamics. We then use a moment-based high-order-low-order representation of the transport equations. Due to the high dimensionality, memory is always a concern in simulating TRT. We form error estimates and adaptivity in time purely based on temperature and radiation energy, for a trivial overhead in computational cost and memory usage compared with the base second order integrators. We then test the adaptivity in time on the tophat and Larsen problem, demonstrating the ability of the adaptive algorithm to naturally vary the timestep across 4--5 orders of magnitude, ranging from the dynamical timescales of the streaming regime to the thick diffusion limit.

Achieving uniformity requires a laser power control system that minimises deviation of the printing temperatures from the target temperature. Because the estimate of the actual process temperature is an input to the laser power control, uncertainty in the estimate of the actual temperature can lead to fluctuations in laser power that affect the thermal performance of the SLS. This article investigates the sensitivity of a laser power control system to temperature measurement uncertainty. This article evaluates the effectiveness of two methods for quantifying the effect of input uncertainty on a SLS laser power control system: a recent innovation in uncertainty-tracked architecture and traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We show that recent advances in computer architecture for arithmatic on probability distributions make it possible for the first time, to perform control system uncertainty analysis with latencies under 30 ms, while achieving the same level of uncertainty analysis as Monte Carlo methods with latencies that are two orders of magnitude slower.

However, practical deployment remains challenged by drift in switching probability caused by thermal fluctuations, device aging, and environmental instability. This work presents an engineering-oriented, drift-resilient MTJ-based TRNG architecture, enabled by a hybrid control strategy that combines self-stabilizing feedback with pulse width modulation. A key component is the Downcalibration-2 scheme, which updates the control parameter every two steps using only integer-resolution timing, ensuring excellent statistical quality without requiring bit discarding, pre-characterization, or external calibration. Extensive experimental measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that this approach maintains stable randomness under dynamic temperature drift, using only simple digital logic. The proposed architecture offers high throughput, robustness, and scalability, making it well-suited for secure hardware applications, embedded systems, and edge computing environments.

This method reduces the data required for a data-driven model of a target building by leveraging knowledge from a source building. Consequently, it enables the creation of data-efficient models that can be used for advanced control and fault detection & diagnosis. A major limitation of the TL approach is its inconsistent performance across different sources. Although accurate source-building selection for a target is crucial, it remains a persistent challenge. We present GenTL, a general transfer learning model for single-family houses in Central Europe. GenTL can be efficiently fine-tuned to a large variety of target buildings. It is pretrained on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with data from 450 different buildings. The general transfer learning model eliminates the need for source-building selection by serving as a universal source for fine-tuning. Comparative analysis with conventional single-source to single-target TL demonstrates the efficacy and reliability of the general pretraining approach. Testing GenTL on 144 target buildings for fine-tuning reveals an average prediction error (RMSE) reduction of 42.1 % compared to fine-tuning single-source models.

This study systematically evaluates how various quantum noise models including dephasing, amplitude damping, depolarizing, thermal noise, bit-flip, and phase-flip affect key QML algorithms (QSVC, Peg-QSVC, QNN, VQC) and feature mapping techniques (ZFeatureMap, ZZFeatureMap, and PauliFeatureMap). Results indicate that QSVC is notably robust under noise, whereas Peg-QSVC and QNN are more sensitive, particularly to depolarizing and amplitude-damping noise. The PauliFeatureMap is especially vulnerable, highlighting difficulties in maintaining accurate classification under noisy conditions. These findings underscore the critical importance of feature map selection and noise mitigation strategies in optimizing QML for genomic classification, with promising implications for personalized medicine.

The proposed approach explicitly accounts for additive manufacturing uncertainties by modeling material porosity as a spatially correlated stochastic field within a multiphase finite element formulation. A risk-averse objective function, incorporating statistical moments of the design objective, is employed in conjunction with chance constraints that enforce mechanical stability by restricting the probability of exceeding critical stress thresholds. To mitigate the prohibitively high computational cost associated with the large-dimensional uncertainty space and Monte Carlo estimations of the objective function's statistical moments, a second-order Taylor expansion is utilized as a control variate. Furthermore, a continuation-based smoothing strategy is introduced to address the non-differentiability of the chance constraints, ensuring compatibility with gradient-based optimization. The resulting framework achieves computational scalability, remaining agnostic to the dimensionality of the stochastic design space. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional thermal break systems for building insulation. The results highlight the framework's capability to solve large-scale, chance-constrained optimal design problems governed by finite element models with uncertain design parameter spaces reaching dimensions in the hundreds of thousands.

Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have shown great potential for modeling complex multiphysics problems in metal AM. While physics-based simulations face the challenge of high computational costs, conventional data-driven ML models require large, labeled training datasets to achieve accurate predictions. Unfortunately, generating large datasets for ML model training through time-consuming experiments or high-fidelity simulations is highly expensive in metal AM. To address these challenges, this study introduces a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that incorporates governing physical laws into deep neural networks (NNs) to predict temperature and thermal stress evolution during the laser metal deposition (LMD) process. The study also discusses the enhanced accuracy and efficiency of the PINN model when supplemented with small simulation data. Furthermore, it highlights the PINN transferability, enabling fast predictions with a set of new process parameters using a pre-trained PINN model as an online soft sensor, significantly reducing computation time compared to physics-based numerical models while maintaining accuracy.

Deep ensembles (DEs) are efficient and scalable methods for UQ in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs); however, their performance is limited when constructed by simply retraining the same DNN multiple times with randomly sampled initializations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method that combines Bayesian optimization (BO) with DE, referred to as BODE, to enhance both predictive accuracy and UQ.
  We apply BODE to a case study involving a Densely connected Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data to predict eddy viscosity in sodium fast reactor thermal stratification modeling. Compared to a manually tuned baseline ensemble, BODE estimates total uncertainty approximately four times lower in a noise-free environment, primarily due to the baseline's overestimation of aleatoric uncertainty. Specifically, BODE estimates aleatoric uncertainty close to zero, while aleatoric uncertainty dominates the total uncertainty in the baseline ensemble. We also observe a reduction of more than 30% in epistemic uncertainty. When Gaussian noise with standard deviations of 5% and 10% is introduced into the data, BODE accurately fits the data and estimates uncertainty that aligns with the data noise. These results demonstrate that BODE effectively reduces uncertainty and enhances predictions in data-driven models, making it a flexible approach for various applications requiring accurate predictions and robust UQ.

As a non-contact alternative, thermal imaging offers a powerful monitoring solution by capturing temperature variations in machines with thermal cameras. In this study, we propose using 2-dimensional Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) to diagnose misalignment and broken rotor faults from thermal images of squirrel-cage induction motors. We evaluate our approach by benchmarking its performance against widely used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including ResNet, EfficientNet, PP-LCNet, SEMNASNet, and MixNet, using a Workswell InfraRed Camera (WIC). Our results demonstrate that Self-ONNs, with their non-linear neurons and self-organizing capability, achieve diagnostic performance comparable to more complex CNN models while utilizing a shallower architecture with just three operational layers. Its streamlined architecture ensures high performance and is well-suited for deployment on edge devices, enabling its use also in more complex multi-function and/or multi-device monitoring systems.

Traditional inspection methods can be dangerous and inefficient, prompting the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that access hard-to-reach areas and capture high-resolution imagery. In this study, we address the challenge of enhancing defect detection on WTBs by integrating thermal and RGB images obtained from UAVs. We propose a multispectral image composition method that combines thermal and RGB imagery through spatial coordinate transformation, key point detection, binary descriptor creation, and weighted image overlay. Using a benchmark dataset of WTB images annotated for defects, we evaluated several state-of-the-art object detection models. Our results show that composite images significantly improve defect detection efficiency. Specifically, the YOLOv8 model's accuracy increased from 91% to 95%, precision from 89% to 94%, recall from 85% to 92%, and F1-score from 87% to 93%. The number of false positives decreased from 6 to 3, and missed defects reduced from 5 to 2. These findings demonstrate that integrating thermal and RGB imagery enhances defect detection on WTBs, contributing to improved maintenance and reliability.

An actuator of this type consumes an average power of about 40 mW during in-air operation. We integrated onboard power and computation into the VLEIBot++ using a custom-built printed circuit board (PCB) and an 11-mAh 3.7-V 507-mg single-cell lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery, which in conjunction enable autonomous swimming for about 20 min on a single charge. This robot can swim at speeds of up to 18.7 mm/s (0.46 Bl/s) and is the first subgram microswimmer with onboard power, actuation, and computation developed to date. Unfortunately, the approach employed to actuate VLEIBot++ prototypes is infeasible for underwater applications because a typical 10-mg bare SMA-based microactuator requires an average power on the order of 800 mW when operating underwater. To address this issue, we introduce a new 13-mg power-efficient high-performance SMA-based microactuator that can function with similar power requirements (approx. 80 mW on average) and actuation performance (approx. 3 mm at low frequencies) in air and water. This design is based on the use of a sealed flexible air-capsule that encloses the SMA wires that drive the microactuator with the purpose of passively controlling the heat-transfer rate of the thermal system. Furthermore, this new power-efficient encapsulated actuator requires low voltages of excitation (3 to 4 V) and simple power electronics to function.

This paper introduces a prototype of PARIS (Precision Application Robot for Inaccessible Spaces): a use-inspired teleoperated mobile robot manipulator system that was conceived, developed, and tested for and selected as a Phase I winner of the U.S. Department of Energy's E-ROBOT Prize. To improve the thermal efficiency of buildings, the PARIS platform supports: 1) teleoperated mapping and navigation, enabling the human operator to explore compact spaces; 2) inspection and sensing, facilitating the identification and localization of under-insulated areas; and 3) air-sealing targeted gaps and cracks through which thermal energy is lost. The resulting versatile platform can also be tailored for targeted application of treatments and remediation in constrained spaces.

This paper proposed a novel silicone fingertip actuator integrated with a hot thermal fabric finger sleeve to render pressure, vibration, and hot thermal feedback simultaneously. The actuator is pneumatically actuated to render a realistic and effective tactile experience in accordance with hot thermal sensation. The silicone actuator, with two air chambers controlled by pneumatic valves connected to compressed air tanks. Simultaneously, a PWM signal from a microcontroller regulates the temperature of the thermal fabric sleeve, enhancing overall system functionality. The lower chamber of the silicone actuator is responsible for pressure feedback, whereas the upper chamber is devoted to vibrotactile feedback. The conductive yarn or thread was utilized to spread the thermal feedback actuation points on the thermal fabric's surface. To demonstrate the actuator's capability, a VR environment consisting of a bowl of liquid and a stove with fire was designed. Based on different functionalities the scenario can simulate the tactile perception of pressure, vibration, and temperature simultaneously or consecutively.

However, metal parts produced via AM can include flaws that cause inferior mechanical properties, including reduced fatigue response, yield strength, and fracture toughness. To address this issue, we leverage convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze thermal images of printed layers, automatically identifying anomalies that impact these properties. We also investigate various synthetic data generation techniques to address limited and imbalanced AM training data. Our models' defect detection capabilities were assessed using images of Nickel alloy 718 layers produced on a laser powder bed fusion AM machine and synthetic datasets with and without added noise. Our results show significant accuracy improvements with synthetic data, emphasizing the importance of expanding training sets for reliable defect detection. Specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-generated datasets streamlined data preparation by eliminating human intervention while maintaining high performance, thereby enhancing defect detection capabilities. Additionally, our denoising approach effectively improves image quality, ensuring reliable defect detection. Finally, our work integrates these models in the CLoud ADditive MAnufacturing (CLADMA) module, a user-friendly interface, to enhance their accessibility and practicality for AM applications. This integration supports broader adoption and practical implementation of advanced defect detection in AM processes.

However, certain processing conditions can lead to inter-layer defects, affecting the final product's quality. This study develops a method to monitor in-process quality using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN models were evaluated on their ability to classify samples with and without embedded thermocouples across five power levels (300W, 600W, 900W, 1200W, 1500W) using thermal images with supervised labeling. Four distinct CNN classification models were created for different scenarios including without (baseline) and with thermocouples, only without thermocouples across power levels, only with thermocouples across power levels, and combined without and with thermocouples across power levels. The models achieved 98.29% accuracy on combined baseline and thermocouple images, 97.10% for baseline images across power levels, 97.43% for thermocouple images, and 97.27% for both types across power levels. The high accuracy, above 97%, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in identifying and classifying conditions within the UAM process, providing a reliable tool for quality assurance and process control in manufacturing environments.

This includes artificial intelligence and thermal surveillance systems to mitigate the impact of extreme meteorological phenomena. RESISTO endeavors to predict, prevent, detect, and recover from weather-related incidents, ultimately enhancing the quality of service provided and ensuring grid stability and efficiency in the face of evolving climate challenges. In this study, we introduce one of the fundamental pillars of the project: a monitoring system for the operating temperature of different regions within power transformers, aiming to detect and alert early on potential thermal anomalies. To achieve this, a distributed system of thermal cameras for real-time temperature monitoring has been deployed in The DoÃ±ana National Park, alongside servers responsible for the storing, analyzing, and alerting of any potential thermal anomalies. An adaptive prediction model was developed for temperature forecasting, which learns online from the newly available data. In order to test the long-term performance of the proposed solution, we generated a synthetic temperature database for the whole of the year 2022.

However, the proverbial "closing of the loop" in experiment-theory cycles in practice are usually ad hoc, often inherently difficult, or impractical to repeat on a systematic basis, beset by the scale or the time constraint of computation or the phenomena under study. Here, we demonstrate Autonomous MAterials Search Engine (AMASE), where we enlist robot science to perform self-driving continuous cyclical interaction of experiments and computational predictions for materials exploration. In particular, we have applied the AMASE formalism to the rapid mapping of a temperature-composition phase diagram, a fundamental task for the search and discovery of new materials. Thermal processing and experimental determination of compositional phase boundaries in thin films are autonomously interspersed with real-time updating of the phase diagram prediction through the minimization of Gibbs free energies. AMASE was able to accurately determine the eutectic phase diagram of the Sn-Bi binary thin-film system on the fly from a self-guided campaign covering just a small fraction of the entire composition - temperature phase space, translating to a 6-fold reduction in the number of necessary experiments. This study demonstrates for the first time the possibility of real-time, autonomous, and iterative interactions of experiments and theory carried out without any human intervention.

However, passive cooling necessitates intelligent thermal control via traffic management, i.e., the instantaneous data traffic or throughput of a PCBS directly impacts its thermal performance. This is particularly challenging for outdoor deployment of PCBSs because the heat dissipation efficiency is uncertain and fluctuates over time. What is more, the PCBSs are interference-coupled in multi-cell scenarios. Thus, a higher-throughput PCBS leads to higher interference to the other PCBSs, which, in turn, would require more resource consumption to meet their respective throughput targets. In this paper, we address online decision-making for maximizing the total downlink throughput for a multi-PCBS system subject to constraints related on operating temperature. We demonstrate that a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, specifically soft actor-critic (SAC), can successfully perform throughput maximization while keeping the PCBSs cool, by adapting the throughput to time-varying heat dissipation conditions. Furthermore, we design a denial and reward mechanism that effectively mitigates the risk of overheating during the exploration phase of RL. Simulation results show that our approach achieves up to 88.6% of the global optimum. This is very promising, as our approach operates without prior knowledge of future heat dissipation efficiency, which is required by the global optimum.

Monitoring rhinos' movement is crucial to their protection but has unfortunately proven difficult because rhinos are elusive. Therefore, instead of tracking rhinos, we propose the novel approach of mapping communal defecation sites, called middens, which give information about rhinos' spatial behavior valuable to anti-poaching, management, and reintroduction efforts. This paper provides the first-ever mapping of rhino midden locations by building classifiers to detect them using remotely sensed thermal, RGB, and LiDAR imagery in passive and active learning settings. As existing active learning methods perform poorly due to the extreme class imbalance in our dataset, we design MultimodAL, an active learning system employing a ranking technique and multimodality to achieve competitive performance with passive learning models with 94% fewer labels. Our methods could therefore save over 76 hours in labeling time when used on a similarly-sized dataset. Unexpectedly, our midden map reveals that rhino middens are not randomly distributed throughout the landscape; rather, they are clustered. Consequently, rangers should be targeted at areas with high midden densities to strengthen anti-poaching efforts, in line with UN Target 15.7.

This paper presents a comprehensive, HPC-enabled workflow for developing and deploying projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs) for large-scale mechanical simulations. We use PyCOMPSs' parallel framework to efficiently execute ROM training simulations, employing parallel singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithms such as randomized SVD, Lanczos SVD, and full SVD based on tall-skinny QR (TSQR). Moreover, we introduce a partitioned version of the hyper-reduction scheme known as the Empirical Cubature Method (ECM) to further enhance computational efficiency in PROMs for mechanical systems. Despite the widespread use of HPC for PROMs, there is a significant lack of publications detailing comprehensive workflows for building and deploying end-to-end PROMs in HPC environments. Our workflow is validated through a case study focusing on the thermal dynamics of a motor, a multiphysics problem involving convective heat transfer and mechanical components. The PROM is designed to deliver a real-time prognosis tool that could enable rapid and safe motor restarts post-emergency shutdowns under different operating conditions, demonstrating its potential impact on the practice of simulations in engineering mechanics. To facilitate deployment, we use the Workflow as a Service (WaaS) strategy and Functional Mock-Up Units (FMUs) to ensure compatibility and ease of integration across HPC, edge, and cloud environments. The outcomes illustrate the efficacy of combining PROMs and HPC, establishing a precedent for scalable, real-time digital twin applications in computational mechanics across multiple industries.

Analysis of a dataset containing over 2,400 COFs reveals that conventional features such as density, pore size, void fraction, and surface area do not reliably predict thermal conductivity. To address this, an attention-based machine learning model was trained, accurately predicting thermal conductivities even for structures outside the training set. The attention mechanism was then utilized to investigate the model's success. The analysis identified dangling molecular branches as a key predictor of thermal conductivity, a discovery supported by feature importance assessments conducted on regression models. These findings indicate that COFs with dangling functional groups exhibit lower thermal transfer capabilities. Molecular dynamics simulations support this observation, revealing significant mismatches in the vibrational density of states due to the presence of dangling branches.

Indeed, the intrinsically iterative nature of optimal control problems requires multiple simulations of the physical system to be controlled. Moreover, the control action needs to be updated whenever the underlying scenario undergoes variations. Full-order models based on, e.g., the Finite Element Method, do not meet these requirements due to the computational burden they usually entail. On the other hand, conventional reduced order modeling techniques such as the Reduced Basis method, are intrusive, rely on a linear superimposition of modes, and lack of efficiency when addressing nonlinear time-dependent dynamics. In this work, we propose a non-intrusive Deep Learning-based Reduced Order Modeling (DL-ROM) technique for the rapid control of systems described in terms of parametrized PDEs in multiple scenarios. In particular, optimal full-order snapshots are generated and properly reduced by either Proper Orthogonal Decomposition or deep autoencoders (or a combination thereof) while feedforward neural networks are exploited to learn the map from scenario parameters to reduced optimal solutions. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction therefore allows us to consider state variables and control actions that are both low-dimensional and distributed. After (i) data generation, (ii) dimensionality reduction, and (iii) neural networks training in the offline phase, optimal control strategies can be rapidly retrieved in an online phase for any scenario of interest. The computational speedup and the high accuracy obtained with the proposed approach are assessed on different PDE-constrained optimization problems, ranging from the minimization of energy dissipation in incompressible flows modelled through Navier-Stokes equations to the thermal active cooling in heat transfer.

We propose an equivalent circuit model (ECM) to capture the thermal and electrical battery behavior. Furthermore, we assess the need for a battery thermal management system (BTMS) by determining heat generation at the cell level and optimize BTMS design to minimize energy consumption over a predefined flight regime. The proposed baseline battery design includes a 304-kWh battery system with BTMS, ensuring failure redundancy through two parallel switched battery banks. Simulation results explore the theoretical flight range without BTMS and reveal advantages in increasing battery capacity under specific conditions. Optimization efforts focus on BTMS design, highlighting the superior performance of water cooling over air cooling. However, the addition of a 9.9 kW water-cooled BTMS results in a 16.5% weight increase (387 kg) compared to no BTMS, reducing the simulated range of the aircraft from 480 km to 410 km. Lastly, we address a heating-induced thermal runaway scenario, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed battery design in preventing thermal runaway.

Despite the availability of various facial RGB datasets, the thermal modality, which plays a crucial role in life sciences, medicine, and biometrics, has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce the T-FAKE dataset, a new large-scale synthetic thermal dataset with sparse and dense landmarks. To facilitate the creation of the dataset, we propose a novel RGB2Thermal loss function, which enables the domain-adaptive transfer of RGB faces to thermal style. By utilizing the Wasserstein distance between thermal and RGB patches and the statistical analysis of clinical temperature distributions on faces, we ensure that the generated thermal images closely resemble real samples. Using RGB2Thermal style transfer based on our RGB2Thermal loss function, we create the large-scale synthetic thermal T-FAKE dataset with landmark and segmentation annotations. Leveraging our novel T-FAKE dataset, probabilistic landmark prediction, and label adaptation networks, we demonstrate significant improvements in landmark detection methods on thermal images across different landmark conventions. Our models show excellent performance with both sparse 70-point landmarks and dense 478-point landmark annotations. Moreover, our RGB2Thermal loss leads to notable results in terms of perceptual evaluation and temperature prediction.

This study applies the NeuralPlasmaODE, a multi-region multi-timescale transport model, to simulate the complex energy transfer processes in ITER deuterium-tritium (D-T) plasmas. Our model captures the interactions between energetic alpha particles, electrons, and ions, which are vital for understanding phenomena such as thermal runaway instability. We employ neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) for the numerical derivation of diffusivity parameters, enabling precise modeling of energy interactions between different plasma regions. By leveraging transfer learning, we utilize model parameters derived from DIII-D experimental data, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of our simulations without training from scratch. Applying this model to ITER's inductive and non-inductive operational scenarios, our results demonstrate that radiation and transport processes effectively remove excess heat from the core plasma, preventing thermal runaway instability.

Key features of NR include Ultra lean carrier design to minimize the power consumption by limiting the always-on signal transmissions and to reduce interference in the neighboring cells . Another feature is the use of massive number of antennas for transmission as well as reception of signals. This rise in the number of antennas to provide a greater coverage brings about various challenges and impact in the system. With the increase in investigations in the mmWave frequencies, there is a need to investigate the health hazards they have on human body and the environment at large. This paper intends to provide an insight into the harmful impacts of Radio Frequency RF fields. The radiation metric to study the RF impact for far field is power density and for near field is Specific Absorption Rate SAR. These are the two main EM radiation metrics to find out the exposure due to uplink and downlink phenomenon in mobile communications. Mobile communication systems are addressed particularly to discuss the Electromagnetic EM Radiation impact as smart phones are used in close proximity to the body. A proposal in the form of Thermal Radiation TR mode is given to reduce the radiations emitted from a mobile phone.

However, directly utilizing the pretrained SAM for Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) task falls short in achieving satisfying performance due to a notable domain gap between natural and infrared images. Unlike a visible light camera, a thermal imager reveals an object's temperature distribution by capturing infrared radiation. Small targets often show a subtle temperature transition at the object's boundaries. To address this issue, we propose the IRSAM model for IRSTD, which improves SAM's encoder-decoder architecture to learn better feature representation of infrared small objects. Specifically, we design a Perona-Malik diffusion (PMD)-based block and incorporate it into multiple levels of SAM's encoder to help it capture essential structural features while suppressing noise. Additionally, we devise a Granularity-Aware Decoder (GAD) to fuse the multi-granularity feature from the encoder to capture structural information that may be lost in long-distance modeling. Extensive experiments on the public datasets, including NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K, validate the design choice of IRSAM and its significant superiority over representative state-of-the-art methods.

For example, a finite-element thermal model with hundreds of elements can take significant time to simulate, which makes it unsuitable for onboard reasoning during time-sensitive scenarios such as descent and landing, proximity operations, or in-space assembly. Further, the lack of fast and accurate thermal modeling drives thermal designs to be more conservative and leads to spacecraft with larger mass and higher power budgets. The emerging paradigm of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) presents a class of hybrid modeling architectures that address this challenge by combining simplified physics models with machine learning (ML) models resulting in models which maintain both interpretability and robustness. Such techniques enable designs with reduced mass and power through onboard thermal-state estimation and control and may lead to improved onboard handling of off-nominal states, including unplanned down-time. The PIML model or hybrid model presented here consists of a neural network which predicts reduced nodalizations (distribution and size of coarse mesh) given on-orbit thermal load conditions, and subsequently a (relatively coarse) finite-difference model operates on this mesh to predict thermal states. We compare the computational performance and accuracy of the hybrid model to a data-driven neural net model, and a high-fidelity finite-difference model of a prototype Earth-orbiting small spacecraft. The PIML based active nodalization approach provides significantly better generalization than the neural net model and coarse mesh model, while reducing computing cost by up to 1.7x compared to the high-fidelity model.

Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS) -- offer promising prototypes -- employ a closed-loop vascular layout that runs deep beneath the Earth's surface. A working fluid (e.g., water or supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2)) circulates through the vasculature, entering the subsurface at the inlet and exiting at the outlet with an elevated temperature. For designing and performing cost-benefit analysis before deploying large-scale projects and maintaining efficiency while enabling real-time monitoring during the operational phase, modeling offers cost-effective solutions; often, it is the only available option for performance assessment. A knowledge gap exists due to the lack of a fast predictive modeling framework that considers the vascular intricacies, particularly the jumps in the solution fields across the channel. Noting that the channel diameter is considerably smaller in scale compared to the surrounding geological domain, we develop a reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for closed-loop geothermal systems. This ROM incorporates the jump conditions and provides a quick and accurate prediction of the temperature field, including the outlet temperature, which directly correlates with the power production capacity and thermal draw-down. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the framework by establishing the uniqueness of the solutions and reporting representative numerical solutions. The modeling framework and the predictions reported in this paper benefit the closed-loop geothermal community, enabling them to determine the system's performance and optimal capacity.

These limitations can be addressed by preheating the LIB with an external heat source or by exploiting the internal heat generation through the LIB's internal impedance. Fast external heating generates large temperature gradients across the LIB due to the low thermal conductivity of the cell, while internal impedance heating (usually through AC or pulse charge/discharging) tends to be relatively slow, although it can achieve more uniform temperature distribution. This paper investigates the potential of combining externally sourced resistive film heating with bidirectional pulse heating to achieve fast preheating without causing steep temperature gradients. The LIB is modeled with the Doyle Fuller Newman (DFN) electrochemical model and 1D thermal model, and reinforcement learning (RL) is used to optimize the pulse current amplitude and film voltage concurrently. The results indicate that the optimal policy for maximizing the rate of temperature rise while limiting temperature gradients has the film heating dominate the initial phases and create the ideal conditions for pulse heating to take over. In addition, the pulse component shares the heating load and reduces the energy rating of the auxiliary power source.

Typically, two storages are combined, one for heat and one for cold, to support heating and cooling of buildings. This way, the use of classical fossil fuel-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning can be significantly reduced. Exploiting the benefits of ATES beyond "seasonal" heating in winter and cooling in summer as well as meeting legislative restrictions requires sophisticated control. We propose a tailored model predictive control (MPC) scheme for the sustainable operation of ATES systems, which mainly builds on a novel model and objective function. The new approach leads to a mixed-integer quadratic program. Its performance is evaluated on real data from an ATES system in Belgium.

While it is essential to detect pedestrians, vehicles, or other obstacles, adverse field conditions negatively affect the performance of classical sensors such as cameras or lidars.

In particular, modern 4D imaging radars provide target responses across the range, vertical angle, horizontal angle and Doppler velocity dimensions. We propose TMVA4D, a CNN architecture that leverages this 4D radar modality for semantic segmentation. The CNN is trained to distinguish between the background and person classes based on a series of 2D projections of the 4D radar data that include the elevation, azimuth, range, and Doppler velocity dimensions. We also outline the process of compiling a novel dataset consisting of data collected in industrial settings with a car-mounted 4D radar and describe how the ground-truth labels were generated from reference thermal images.

Among them, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) stands out as one of the best-known methods. However, the complexity of TRIZ and its reliance on users' knowledge, experience, and reasoning capabilities limit its practicality. To address this, we introduce AutoTRIZ, an artificial ideation system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the TRIZ methodology. By leveraging LLMs' vast pre-trained knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities, AutoTRIZ offers a novel, generative, and interpretable approach to engineering innovation. AutoTRIZ takes a problem statement from the user as its initial input, automatically conduct the TRIZ reasoning process and generates a structured solution report. We demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of AutoTRIZ through comparative experiments with textbook cases and a real-world application in the design of a Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS). Moreover, the proposed LLM-based framework holds the potential for extension to automate other knowledge-based ideation methods, such as SCAMPER, Design Heuristics, and Design-by-Analogy, paving the way for a new era of AI-driven innovation tools.

Different aging mechanisms such as Negative-Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI), Electromigration (EM), and thermal cycling can reduce the reliability of these systems. However, state-of-the-art works mainly focused on NBTI and EM, whereas a few works have considered the thermal cycling effect. The thermal cycling effect can significantly aggravate the systems lifetime. Moreover, the thermal effects of cores on each other due to their adjacency may also influence the systems Mean Time to Failure (MTTF). This paper introduces a new technique to manage the reliability of manycore systems. The technique considers thermal cycling, adjacency of cores, and process variation-induced diversity of operating frequencies. It uses two levels of task mapping to improve system lifetime. At the first level, cores with close temperatures are packed into the same bin, and then, an arrived task is assigned to a bin with a similar temperature. Afterward in the second level, the task is assigned to a core inside the selected bin in the first level, based on performance requirements and the core frequency. Compared to the conventional TC-aware techniques, the proposed method is performed at a higher level (bins level) to reduce the thermal variations of cores inside a bin, and improves the system MTTFTC, making it a promising solution for manycore systems. The efficacy of our proposed technique is evaluated on 16, 32, 64, and 256 core systems using SPLASH2 and PARSEC benchmark suite applications. The results show up to 20% MTTFTC increment compared to the conventional thermal cycling-aware task mapping techniques.

For smart energy management in buildings, usage patterns and their resulting profiles allow the improvement of control systems with prediction capabilities. However, for large-scale HVAC system management, it is difficult to construct a detailed model for each subsystem. In this paper, a new data-driven room temperature prediction model is proposed based on the k-means clustering method. The proposed data-driven temperature prediction approach extracts the system operation feature through historical data analysis and further simplifies the system-level model to improve generalization and computational efficiency. We evaluate the proposed approach in the real world. The results demonstrated that our approach can significantly reduce modeling time without reducing prediction accuracy.

The addition of the TES tank to the original refrigeration plant allows to schedule the cooling production regardless of the instantaneous demand, given that the TES tank can store cold energy and release it whenever deemed appropriate. The scheduling problem is posed as an optimization problem based on mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP), since it includes both discrete and continuous variables. The latter corresponds to the references on the main cooling powers involved in the problem (cooling production at the evaporator and TES charging/discharging), whereas the discrete variables define the operating mode scheduling. Therefore, in addition to the hybrid features of the physical plant, a hybrid optimal control strategy is also proposed. A receding horizon approach is applied, similar to model predictive control (MPC) strategies, while economic criteria are imposed in the objective function, as well as feasibility issues. The TES state estimation is also addressed, since its instantaneous charge ratio is not measurable. The proposed strategy is applied in simulation to a challenging cooling demand profile and the main advantages of the MINLP-based strategy over a non-linear MPC-based scheduling strategy previously developed are highlighted, regarding operating cost, ease of tuning, and ability to adapt to cooling demand variations.

Cold-energy production supported by TES systems is a very appealing field of research, since it allows flexible cold-energy management, combining demand fulfilment with cost reduction strategies. The paper proposes and compares two different simulation models for a cold-energy storage system based on PCM. First, a continuous model is developed, the application of which is limited to decoupled charging/discharging operations. Given such conditions, it is a relatively precise model, useful for the tuning of the TES parameters. The second proposed model is a discrete one, which, despite implementing a discrete approximation of the system behaviour, allows to study more general conditions, such as series of partial charging/discharging operations. Simulation results of both models are compared regarding decoupled charging/discharging operations, and the ability of the discrete model to represent more realistic partial operations is analysed.

Given a novel design of a PCM-based TES tank and its interconnection with an existing refrigeration system, the joint dynamic modelling is first studied, exploring the different time scales that coexist at the interconnected system. Diverse operating modes are defined, according to the intended use of the TES tank as a cold-energy buffer to decouple cooling demand and production, whereas the static characteristic and power limits are calculated and show the high coupling between the main cooling powers involved (TES charging/discharging power, and direct power production at the evaporator). In this light, a decoupling control strategy is proposed, where the low-level controllers are simply PI regulators and the refrigerant/secondary mass flows are considered as virtual manipulated variables, applying a feedforward-based cascade strategy. The control performance is evaluated through a thorough simulation that includes all operating modes, where the reference tracking is shown to be fast and reliable enough to address high-level scheduling strategies, where the references on the main cooling powers are intended to be imposed considering economic and efficiency criteria.

Taking as a starting point the recent design of a TES system based on PCM, designed to complement a vapour-compression refrigeration plant, the new highly efficient modelling strategy is described and its performance is compared against the pre-existing one. The need for a new computationally efficient approach comes from the fact that, in the near future, such a TES model is intended to be used in combination with the model of the own mother refrigeration plant, in order to address efficient, long-term energy management strategies, where computation time will become a major issue. Comparative simulations show that the proposed computationally efficient strategy reduces the simulation time to a small fraction of the original figure (from around 1/30th till around 1/120th, depending on the particular choice of the main sampling interval), at the expense of affordable inaccuracy in terms of the PCM charge ratio.

Often, one needs to modulate the temperature field to achieve the intended functionalities (e.g., self-healing) in these lightweight structures. Vascular-based active cooling offers one efficient way of thermal regulation in such material systems. However, the thermophysical properties (e.g., thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity) of FRC and their base constituents depend on temperature, and such structures are often subject to a broad spectrum of temperatures. Notably, prior active cooling modeling studies did not account for such temperature dependence. Thus, the primary aim of this paper is to reveal the effect of temperature-dependent material properties -- obtained via material characterization -- on the qualitative and quantitative behaviors of active cooling. By applying mathematical analysis and conducting numerical simulations, we show this dependence does not affect qualitative attributes, such as minimum and maximum principles (in the same spirit as \textsc{Hopf}'s results for elliptic partial differential equations). However, the dependence slightly affects quantitative results, such as the mean surface temperature and thermal efficiency. The import of our study is that it provides a deeper understanding of thermal regulation systems under practical scenarios and can guide researchers and practitioners in perfecting associated designs.

The substantial amount of matter and energy that SNe release provides significant feedback to star formation and gas dynamics in a galaxy. SNe release a substantial amount of matter and energy to the interstellar medium, resulting in significant feedback to star formation and gas dynamics in a galaxy. While such feedback has a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution, in simulations of galaxy formation, it has only been implemented using simple {\it sub-grid models} instead of numerically solving the evolution of gas elements around SNe in detail due to a lack of resolution. We develop a method combining machine learning and Gibbs sampling to predict how a supernova (SN) affects the surrounding gas. The fidelity of our model in the thermal energy and momentum distribution outperforms the low-resolution SN simulations. Our method can replace the SN sub-grid models and help properly simulate un-resolved SN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. We find that employing our new approach reduces the necessary computational cost to $\sim$ 1 percent compared to directly resolving SN feedback.

A multi-objective model predictive control (MPC) framework is developed to optimize the fast charging performance while enforcing the constraints in the power and thermal loops. The approach takes into account the coupling of the battery and cabin thermal management. The case study of a commercial EV demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively meet the requirements of fast charging and thermal management when accurate preview information is available. However, failure to predict the charging event can result in performance degradation with longer charging time. A time-varying weighting strategy is proposed to enhance charging performance in the presence of uncertainty. This strategy leverages the battery state-of-charge (SOC) and adjusts the priority of the multi-objective MPC at different phases during charging. Simulated results using a commercial EV use case show improved robustness in charging time using the proposed strategy.

This expansion also requires larger and ever so complex experimental pilot environments driving the demand for geographically distributed multi-research infrastructure tests. The Holistic Test Description approach supports the design of multi-domain and multi-research infrastructure tests by organizing the test cases into comprehensive segments, ensuring all relevant items for testing are covered. These test cases eventually form a pool, which to understand holistically would require studying and reading all the descriptions. This work proposes therefore the concept of Test Case Profiles to improve test case discovery and the structured creation of them.

Along with the proposed indexing method, four different use cases are introduced to motivate additional applications of the proposed concept.

An infrared observatory was operated over a few months to collect thermal images of different types of buildings on the educational campus of the National University of Singapore. A subset of the thermal image dataset was used to train state-of-the-art deep learning models to segment various urban features such as buildings, vegetation, sky, and roads. It was observed that the U-Net segmentation model with `resnet34' CNN backbone has the highest mIoU score of 0.99 on the test dataset, compared to other models such as DeepLabV3, DeeplabV3+, FPN, and PSPnet. The masks generated using the segmentation models were then used to extract the temperature from thermal images and correct for differences in the emissivity of various urban features. Further, various statistical measure of the temperature extracted using the predicted segmentation masks is shown to closely match the temperature extracted using the ground truth masks. Finally, the masks were used to identify hot and cool spots in the urban feature at various instances of time. This forms one of the very few studies demonstrating the automated analysis of thermal images, which can be of potential use to urban planners for devising mitigation strategies for reducing the urban heat island (UHI) effect, improving building energy efficiency, and maximizing outdoor thermal comfort.

In this paper, we show that multi-modal embeddings can be vulnerable to an attack we call "adversarial illusions." Given an image or a sound, an adversary can perturb it to make its embedding close to an arbitrary, adversary-chosen input in another modality.
  These attacks are cross-modal and targeted: the adversary can align any image or sound with any target of his choice. Adversarial illusions exploit proximity in the embedding space and are thus agnostic to downstream tasks and modalities, enabling a wholesale compromise of current and future tasks, as well as modalities not available to the adversary. Using ImageBind and AudioCLIP embeddings, we demonstrate how adversarially aligned inputs, generated without knowledge of specific downstream tasks, mislead image generation, text generation, zero-shot classification, and audio retrieval.
  We investigate transferability of illusions across different embeddings and develop a black-box version of our method that we use to demonstrate the first adversarial alignment attack on Amazon's commercial, proprietary Titan embedding. Finally, we analyze countermeasures and evasion attacks.

This has led to the development of reduced-order models (ROMs) that are accurate but faster than full order models (FOMs). Recently, machine learning advances have enabled the creation of non-linear projection methods, such as Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI). LaSDI maps full-order PDE solutions to a latent space using autoencoders and learns the system of ODEs governing the latent space dynamics. By interpolating and solving the ODE system in the reduced latent space, fast and accurate ROM predictions can be made by feeding the predicted latent space dynamics into the decoder. In this paper, we introduce GPLaSDI, a novel LaSDI-based framework that relies on Gaussian process (GP) for latent space ODE interpolations. Using GPs offers two significant advantages. First, it enables the quantification of uncertainty over the ROM predictions. Second, leveraging this prediction uncertainty allows for efficient adaptive training through a greedy selection of additional training data points. This approach does not require prior knowledge of the underlying PDEs. Consequently, GPLaSDI is inherently non-intrusive and can be applied to problems without a known PDE or its residual. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Burgers equation, Vlasov equation for plasma physics, and a rising thermal bubble problem. Our proposed method achieves between 200 and 100,000 times speed-up, with up to 7% relative error.

To address the battery cooling optimization problem, this paper utilizes dynamic programming (DP) to develop an online rule-based control strategy. Firstly, an electrical-thermal-aging model of the $\rm LiFePO_4$ battery pack is established. A control-oriented onboard BTMS model is proposed and verified under different speed profiles and temperatures. Then in the DP framework, a cost function consisting of battery aging cost and cooling-induced electricity cost is minimized to obtain the optimal compressor power. By exacting three rules "fast cooling, slow cooling, and temperature-maintaining" from the DP result, a near-optimal rule-based cooling strategy, which uses as much regenerative energy as possible to cool the battery pack, is proposed for online execution. Simulation results show that the proposed online strategy can dramatically improve the driving economy and reduce battery degradation under diverse operation conditions, achieving less than a 3% difference in battery loss compared to the offline DP. Recommendations regarding battery cooling under different real-world cases are finally provided.

As the electricity consumption tends to increase every year, limited line thermal capacity can lead to network congestion. Continuous development and upgradation of the distribution network is thus required to meet the energy demand, which poses a significant increase in cost. The objective of this research is to analyze distribution network topologies and introduce a topology reconfiguration scheme based on the cost and demand of electricity. Traditional electrical distribution networks are static and inefficient. To make the network active, an optimal dynamic network topology reconfiguration (DNTR) is proposed to control line switching and reconnect some loads to different substations such that the cost of electricity can be minimized. The proposed DNTR strategy was tested on a synthetic radial distribution network with three substations each connecting to an IEEE 13-bus system. Simulation results demonstrated significant cost saving in daily operations of this distribution system.

In this work, a novel higher-order multi-scale deep Ritz method (HOMS-DRM) is developed for thermal transfer equation of authentic composite materials with highly oscillatory and discontinuous coefficients. In this novel HOMS-DRM, higher-order multi-scale analysis and modeling are first employed to overcome limitations of prohibitive computation and Frequency Principle when direct deep learning simulation. Then, improved deep Ritz method are designed to high-accuracy and mesh-free simulation for macroscopic homogenized equation without multi-scale property and microscopic lower-order and higher-order cell problems with highly discontinuous coefficients. Moreover, the theoretical convergence of the proposed HOMS-DRM is rigorously demonstrated under appropriate assumptions. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are presented to show the computational accuracy of the proposed HOMS-DRM. This study offers a robust and high-accuracy multi-scale deep learning framework that enables the effective simulation and analysis of multi-scale problems of authentic composite materials.

Both inaccuracy and nonuniformity are dependent on the ambient temperature of the camera. The goal of this work was to estimate temperatures with low-cost infrared cameras, and rectify the nonuniformity.
  A nonuniformity simulator that accounts for the ambient temperature was developed. An end-to-end neural network that incorporates both the physical model of the camera and the ambient camera temperature was introduced. The neural network was trained with the simulated nonuniformity data to estimate the object's temperature and correct the nonuniformity, using only a single image and the ambient temperature measured by the camera itself. Results of the proposed method significantly improved the mean temperature error compared to previous works by up to $0.5^\circ C$. In addition, constraining the physical model of the camera with the network lowered the error by an additional $0.1^\circ C$.
  The mean temperature error over an extensive validation dataset was $0.37^\circ C$. The method was verified on real data in the field and produced equivalent results.

Existing methods try to find an optimal fusion feature for segmentation, resulting in sensitivity to modality noise, class-imbalance, and modality bias. To overcome the problems, this paper proposes a novel Variational Probabilistic Fusion Network (VPFNet), which regards fusion features as random variables and obtains robust segmentation by averaging segmentation results under multiple samples of fusion features. The random samples generation of fusion features in VPFNet is realized by a novel Variational Feature Fusion Module (VFFM) designed based on variation attention. To further avoid class-imbalance and modality bias, we employ the weighted cross-entropy loss and introduce prior information of illumination and category to control the proposed VFFM. Experimental results on MFNet and PST900 datasets demonstrate that the proposed VPFNet can achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance.

Existing methods that rely solely on RGB images suffer from performance degradation under low-light conditions due to the lack of useful information. To address this issue, recent multispectral detection approaches have combined thermal images to provide complementary information and have obtained enhanced performances. Nevertheless, few approaches focus on the negative effects of false positives caused by noisy fused feature maps. Different from them, we comprehensively analyze the impacts of false positives on the detection performance and find that enhancing feature contrast can significantly reduce these false positives. In this paper, we propose a novel target-aware fusion strategy for multispectral pedestrian detection, named TFDet. TFDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two multispectral pedestrian benchmarks, KAIST and LLVIP. TFDet can easily extend to multi-class object detection scenarios. It outperforms the previous best approaches on two multispectral object detection benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD. Importantly, TFDet has comparable inference efficiency to the previous approaches, and has remarkably good detection performance even under low-light conditions, which is a significant advancement for ensuring road safety.

This concept can make the material design pathway a challenging task, since modeling the whole design space is neither effective nor feasible. We propose an approach to design high-performance architectured ceramics using machine learning (ML) with data from finite element analysis (FEA). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are used as the deep learning approaches. A limited set of FEA simulation data containing a variety of architectural design parameters is used to train our neural networks, including learning how independent and dependent design parameters are related. A trained network is then used to predict the optimum structure from the configurations. A FEA simulation is run on the best predictions of both MLP and CNN algorithms to evaluate the performance of our networks. Although a limited amount of simulation data are available, our networks are effective in predicting the transient thermo-mechanical responses of possible panel designs. For example, the optimal design after using CNN prediction resulted in $\approx \! 30\%$ improvement in terms of edge temperature.

In this work, we experimentally investigate an interconnected system based on an ultrafast spiking VCSEL-neuron and a silicon photonics (SiPh) integrated micro-ring resonator (MRR) weight bank, and demonstrate two different functional arrangements of these devices. First, we show that MRR weightbanks can be used in conjuction with the spiking VCSEL-neurons to perform amplitude weighting of sub-ns optical spiking signals. Second, we show that a continuous firing VCSEL-neuron can be directly modulated using a locking signal propagated through a single weighting micro-ring, and we utilize this functionality to perform optical spike firing rate-coding via thermal tuning of the micro-ring resonator. Given the significant track record of both integrated weight banks and photonic VCSEL-neurons, we believe these results demonstrate the viability of combining these two classes of devices for use in functional neuromorphic photonic systems.

In this paper, we propose and compare two approaches using Model Predictive Control (MPC) to compute optimal voltage references for the power electronic devices in order to minimize the losses in a DC microgrid: i) a traditional setpoint-tracking MPC which receives a previously computed optimal setpoint; ii) an economic MPC which does not require a priori computed setpoints. We show that the economic MPC outperforms the setpoint-tracking MPC in simulations with the CIGRE benchmark system when multiple load disturbances occur. Some insights and discussions related to the stability of the closed-loop system using its dissipativity properties are highlighted for both approaches.

Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods are commonly used for simulating reconnection from first principles. While much progress has been made in understanding the physics of reconnection, especially in 2D, the adoption of advanced algorithms and numerical techniques for efficiently modeling such systems has been limited. With the GPU-accelerated PIC code WarpX, we explore the accuracy and potential performance benefits of two advanced Maxwell solver algorithms: a non-standard finite difference scheme (CKC) and an ultrahigh-order pseudo-spectral method (PSATD). We find that for the relativistic reconnection problem, CKC and PSATD qualitatively and quantitatively match the standard Yee-grid finite-difference method. CKC and PSATD both admit a time step that is 40% longer than Yee, resulting in a ~40% faster time to solution for CKC, but no performance benefit for PSATD when using a current deposition scheme that satisfies Gauss's law. Relaxing this constraint maintains accuracy and yields a 30% speedup. Unlike Yee and CKC, PSATD is numerically stable at any time step, allowing for a larger time step than with the finite-difference methods. We found that increasing the time step 2.4-3 times over the standard Yee step still yields accurate results, but only translates to modest performance improvements over CKC due to the current deposition scheme used with PSATD. Further optimization of this scheme will likely improve the effective performance of PSATD.

In practice, this requires the computation of expensive high-dimensional integrals over all of phase space of an atomistic ensemble. This, in turn, is commonly accomplished efficiently by low-order numerical quadrature. We show that numerical quadrature in this context, unfortunately, comes with a set of inherent problems, which corrupt the accuracy of simulations -- especially when dealing with crystal lattices with imperfections. As a remedy, we demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks, trained on Monte-Carlo data, can serve as a replacement for commonly used numerical quadrature rules, overcoming their deficiencies and significantly improving the accuracy. This is showcased by three benchmarks: the thermal expansion of copper, the martensitic phase transition of iron, and the energy of grain boundaries. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed technique over classically used third- and fifth-order Gaussian quadrature, we highlight the impact on time-coarsened atomistic predictions, and we discuss the computational efficiency. The latter is of general importance when performing frequent evaluation of phase space or other high-dimensional integrals, which is why the proposed framework promises applications beyond the scope of atomistics.

However, private and personal information can be easily leaked through cameras during video conferencing. This includes leakage of a person's appearance as well as the contents in the background. This paper proposes a novel way of using online low-resolution thermal images as conditions to guide the synthesis of RGB images, bringing a promising solution for real-time video conferencing when privacy leakage is a concern. SPADE-SR (Spatially-Adaptive De-normalization with Self Resampling), a variant of SPADE, is adopted to incorporate the spatial property of a thermal heatmap and the non-thermal property of a normal, privacy-free pre-recorded RGB image provided in a form of latent code. We create a PAIR-LRT-Human (LRT = Low-Resolution Thermal) dataset to validate our claims. The result enables a convenient way of video conferencing where users no longer need to groom themselves and tidy up backgrounds for a short meeting.

Because of the flexibility and availability of proven fabrication techniques, vascular-based thermal regulation is attractive for thin microvascular systems. Although preliminary designs and experiments demonstrate the feasibility of thermal modulation by pushing fluid through embedded micro-vasculatures, one has yet to optimize the performance before translating the concept into real-world applications. It will be beneficial to know how two vital design variables -- host material's thermal conductivity and fluid's heat capacity rate -- affect a thermal regulation system's performance, quantified in terms of the mean surface temperature. This paper fills the remarked inadequacy by performing adjoint-based sensitivity analysis and unravels a surprising non-monotonic trend. Increasing thermal conductivity can either increase or decrease the mean surface temperature; the increase happens if countercurrent heat exchange -- transfer of heat from one segment of the vasculature to another -- is significant. In contrast, increasing the heat capacity rate will invariably lower the mean surface temperature, for which we provide mathematical proof. The reported results (a) dispose of some misunderstandings in the literature, especially on the effect of the host material's thermal conductivity, (b) reveal the role of countercurrent heat exchange in altering the effects of design variables, and (c) guide designers to realize efficient microvascular active-cooling systems. The analysis and findings will advance the field of thermal regulation both on theoretical and practical fronts.

This calls for a more careful consideration of unit commitment (UC) and primary frequency response (PFR) reserves. This paper studies frequency-secured UC under significant wind power uncertainty. We coordinate the thermal units and wind farms to provide frequency support, wherein we optimize the variable inverter droop factors of the wind farms for higher economy. In addition, we adopt distributionally robust chance constraints (DRCCs) to handle the wind power uncertainty. To depict the frequency dynamics, we incorporate a differential-algebraic equation (DAE) with the dead band into the UC model. Notably, we apply Bernstein polynomials to derive tight inner approximation of the DAE and obtain mixed-integer linear constraints, which can be computed in off-the-shelf solvers. Case studies demonstrate the tightness and effectiveness of the proposed method in guaranteeing frequency security.

Our method iteratively subtracts thermal noises or perturbations in atomic positions using a denoising score function trained on synthetically noised but otherwise perfect crystal lattices. The resulting denoised structures clearly reveal underlying crystal order while retaining disorder associated with crystal defects. Purely geometric, agnostic to interatomic potentials, and trained without inputs from explicit simulations, our denoiser can be applied to simulation data generated from vastly different interatomic interactions. The denoiser is shown to improve existing classification methods such as common neighbor analysis and polyhedral template matching, reaching perfect classification accuracy on a recent benchmark dataset of thermally perturbed structures up to the melting point. Demonstrated here in a wide variety of atomistic simulation contexts, the denoiser is general, robust, and readily extendable to delineate order from disorder in structurally and chemically complex materials.

In addition, the other well-known numerical artefact, dispersion error (artificial oscillations emerging at sharp changes), should also be minimal to avoid confusion with the true wavy behaviour. The continuum thermodynamical aspects (respect for balances with fluxes, systematic constitutive relationships between intensive quantities and fluxes, the second law of thermodynamics with positive definite entropy production, and the spacetime-based kinematic viewpoint) prove valuable for obtaining such extended schemes and for monitoring the solutions. Generalizing earlier works in this direction, here, we establish and investigate such a numerical scheme for one-dimensional viscoelastic wave propagation in the presence of heat conduction coupled via thermal expansion, demonstrating long-term reliability and the applicability of thermodynamics-based quantities in supervising the quality of the solution.

To achieve this first, an image processing scheme, for cleaning and extraction of the temperature time series from the thermal images is implemented. To test the accuracy of the thermal measurements using IR camera, the extracted temperature is compared against the ground truth surface temperature measurements. It is observed that the detrended thermal measurements match well with the ground truth surface temperature measurements. Subsequently, the operational pattern of the water-cooled systems and window AC units are extracted from the analysis of the thermal signature. It is observed that for the water-cooled system, the difference between the rate of change of the window and wall can be used to extract the operational pattern. While, in the case of the window AC units, wavelet transform of the AC unit temperature is used to extract the frequency and time domain information of the AC unit operation. The results of the analysis are compared against the indoor temperature sensors installed in the office spaces of the building. It is realized that the accuracy in the prediction of the operational pattern is highest between 8 pm to 10 am, and it reduces during the day because of solar radiation and high daytime temperature. Subsequently, a characterization study is conducted for eight window/split AC units from the thermal image collected during the nighttime. This forms one of the first studies on the operational behavior of HVAC systems for non-residential buildings using the longitudinal thermal imaging technique. The output from this study can be used to better understand the operational and occupant behavior, without requiring to deploy a large array of sensors in the building space.

This paper introduces Cozie Apple, an open-source mobile and smartwatch application for iOS devices. This platform allows people to complete a watch-based micro-survey and provide real-time feedback about environmental conditions via their Apple Watch. It leverages the inbuilt sensors of a smartwatch to collect physiological (e.g., heart rate, activity) and environmental (sound level) data. This paper outlines data collected from 48 research participants who used the platform to report perceptions of urban-scale environmental comfort (noise and thermal) and contextual factors such as who they were with and what activity they were doing. The results of 2,400 micro-surveys across various urban settings are illustrated in this paper showing the variability of noise-related distractions, thermal comfort, and associated context. The results show people experience at least a little noise distraction 58% of the time, with people talking being the most common reason (46%). This effort is novel due to its focus on spatial and temporal scalability and collection of noise, distraction, and associated contextual information. These data set the stage for larger deployments, deeper analysis, and more helpful prediction models toward better understanding the occupants' needs and perceptions. These innovations could result in real-time control signals to building systems or nudges for people to change their behavior.

Thermal images were collected from an observatory operating on the rooftop of a building between November 2021 and April 2022. Over the same period, an automatic weather station network was used to measure weather conditions at several locations on a university campus in Singapore. From data collected by the observatory and the automatic weather station network, a method was developed to estimate the heat emitted by building facades, vegetation, and traffic. Before performing the analysis of urban heat fluxes, it was observed that the surface temperature collected from the observatory is sensitive to some variables. After the sensitivity analysis, thermal images were calibrated against measurements of the surface temperature in an outdoor environment. Finally, several contributors and mitigators of urban heat islands were analyzed from heat fluxes assessed with thermal images and weather data. According to thermal images collected by the rooftop observatory, concrete walls are an important contributor to urban heat islands due to the longwave radiation they emit at night. Vegetation, on the other hand, seems to be an effective mitigator because of latent heat fluxes generated by evapotranspiration. Traffic looks to be a negligible source of heat if considered over a small portion of a road. In the future, more efforts can be made to estimate the magnitude of the heat released by an air-conditioning system from thermal images.

In contrast to prior efforts, this review encompasses all RS systems and emphasizes ML/DL methods to investigate their strengths and weaknesses. We parse existing literature based on multi- or hyper-spectral analyses and distill their knowledge based on: bark beetle species & attack phases with a primary emphasis on early stages of attacks, host trees, study regions, RS platforms & sensors, spectral/spatial/temporal resolutions, spectral signatures, spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), ML approaches, learning schemes, task categories, models, algorithms, classes/clusters, features, and DL networks & architectures. Although DL-based methods and the random forest (RF) algorithm showed promising results, highlighting their potential to detect subtle changes across visible, thermal, and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions, they still have limited effectiveness and high uncertainties. To inspire novel solutions to these shortcomings, we delve into the principal challenges & opportunities from different perspectives, enabling a deeper understanding of the current state of research and guiding future research directions.

The combined effect of low-light and glare from vehicle headlight or tail-light results in misses in vehicle detection more likely by state-of-the-art object detection models. However, thermal infrared images are robust to illumination changes and are based on thermal radiation. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been extensively used in image domain transfer tasks. State-of-the-art GAN models have attempted to improve vehicle detection accuracy in night-time by converting infrared images to day-time RGB images. However, these models have been found to under-perform during night-time conditions compared to day-time conditions, as day-time infrared images looks different than night-time infrared images. Therefore, this study attempts to alleviate this shortcoming by proposing three different approaches based on combination of GAN models at two different levels that try to reduce the feature distribution gap between day-time and night-time infrared images. Quantitative analysis to compare the performance of the proposed models with the state-of-the-art models has been done by testing the models using state-of-the-art object detection models. Both the quantitative and qualitative analyses have shown that the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art GAN models for vehicle detection in night-time conditions, showing the efficacy of the proposed models.

This stochastic TQG model is intended as a basis for parametrisation of the dynamical creation of unresolved degrees of freedom in computational simulations of upper ocean dynamics when horizontal buoyancy gradients and bathymetry affect the dynamics, particularly at the submesoscale (250m--10km). Specifically, we have chosen the SALT (Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport) algorithm introduced in [1] and applied in [2,3] as our modelling approach. The SALT approach preserves the Kelvin circulation theorem and an infinite family of integral conservation laws for TQG. The goal of the SALT algorithm is to quantify the uncertainty in the process of up-scaling, or coarse-graining of either observed or synthetic data at fine scales, for use in computational simulations at coarser scales. The present work provides a rigorous mathematical analysis of the solution properties of the thermal quasigeostrophic (TQG) equations with stochastic advection by Lie transport (SALT) [4,5].

More precisely, we consider a total of 12 classical square lattice Boltzmann schemes with prescribed sets of conserved and nonconserved moments. The question is to determine the algebraic expressions of the equilibrium functions for the nonconserved moments and the relaxation parameters associated to each scheme. We compare the fluid equations and the result of the Taylor expansion method at second order accuracy for bidimensional examples with a maximum of 17 velocities and three-dimensional schemes with at most 33 velocities. In some cases, it is not possible to fit exactly the physical model. For several examples, we adjust the Navier Stokes equations and propose nontrivial expressions for the equilibria.

As an efficient numerical solution approach for such problems, we introduce and analyze a new relaxed and localized trust-region reduced basis method. Localization is obtained based on a Petrov-Galerkin localized orthogonal decomposition method and its recently introduced two-scale reduced basis approximation. We derive efficient localizable a posteriori error estimates for the optimality system, as well as for the two-scale reduced objective functional. While the relaxation of the outer trust-region optimization loop still allows for a rigorous convergence result, the resulting method converges much faster due to larger step sizes in the initial phase of the iterative algorithms. The resulting algorithm is parallelized in order to take advantage of the localization. Numerical experiments are given for a multiscale thermal block benchmark problem. The experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the approach, particularly for large scale problems, where methods based on traditional finite element approximation schemes are prohibitive or fail entirely.

The control objective is to track the intake manifold pressure and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate targets by manipulating the EGR valve and variable geometry turbine (VGT) while satisfying state and control constraints. The MPC controller is designed and verified using a high-fidelity engine model in GT-Power. The controller exploits a low-order rate-based linear parameter-varying (LPV) model for prediction which is identified from transient response data generated by the GT-Power model. It is shown that transient engine thermal dynamics influence the airpath dynamics, specifically the intake manifold pressure response, however, MPC demonstrates robustness against inaccuracies in modeling these thermal dynamics. In particular, we show that MPC can be successfully implemented using a rate-based prediction model with two inputs (EGR and VGT positions) identified from data with steady-state wall temperature dynamics, however, closed-loop performance can be improved if a prediction model (i) is identified from data with transient thermal dynamics, and (ii) has the fuel injection rate as extra model input. Further, the MPC calibration process across the engine operating range to achieve improved performance is addressed. As the MPC calibration is shown to be sensitive to the operating conditions, a fast calibration process is proposed.

In particular, circular manufacturing supply chains and carbon control networks are urgently needed. To model and design these and, in general, any material networks, we propose to generalize the approach used for traditional networks such as water and thermal power systems by using compartmental dynamical thermodynamics and graph theory. The key idea is that the thermodynamic compartments and their connections can be added, removed or modified as needed to achieve a circular material flow. The design methodology is explained and its application is illustrated through examples. In addition, we provide a physics-based definition of circularity and, by implementing a nonlinear compartmental control, we strengthen the connection between "Industry 4.0" and "Sustainability".

In addition, we present an implicit correction for SPH simulations, based on well known approaches, from which we can observe improved performance and simulation stability. We apply our SPH method to the impact and solidification of Al$_2$O$_3$ droplets onto a free slip substrate and perform a rigorous quantitative comparison of our method with the commercial software Ansys Fluent using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) approach, while taking identical physical effects into consideration. The results are evaluated in depth and we discuss the applicability of either method for the simulation of thermal spray deposition. We show that SPH is an excellent method for solving this free surface problem accurately and efficiently.

Discretization of the RTSWE in space with centered finite differences leads to Hamiltonian system of ordinary differential equations with linear and quadratic terms. The full-order model (FOM) is obtained by applying linearly implicit Kahan's method in time. Applying proper orthogonal decomposition with Galerkin projection (POD-G), we construct the intrusive reduced-order model (ROM). We apply operator inference (OpInf) with re-projection for non-intrusive reduced-order modeling. In the parametric case, we make use of the parameter dependency at the level of the PDE without interpolating between the reduced operators. The least-squares problem of the OpInf is regularized with the minimum norm solution. Both ROMs behave similar and are able to accurately predict the test and training data and capture system behavior in the prediction phase with several orders of computational speedup over the FOM. The preservation of system physics such as the conserved quantities of the RTSWE by both ROMs enables that the models fit better to data and stable solutions are obtained in long-term predictions, which are robust to parameter changes.

The proposed PCS is able to provide precise tracking of the time-varying cooling power trajectory, which is assumed to match the passenger comfort requirements. In addition, by leveraging the emerging connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) technology, vehicle speed preview can be incorporated in our A/C thermal management strategy for further energy efficiency improvement. This proposed A/C thermal management strategy is developed and evaluated based on a physics-based A/C system model (ACSim) from Ford Motor Company for the vehicles with electrified powertrains. In a comparison with Ford benchmark case over SC03 cycle, for tracking the same cooling power trajectory, the proposed PCS provides 4.9% energy saving at the cost of a slight increase in the cabin temperature (less than 1$^oC$). It is also demonstrated that by coordinating with future vehicle speed and shifting the A/C power load, the A/C energy consumption can be further reduced.

This paper presents an integrated power and thermal management (i-PTM) scheme for the optimization of power split, engine thermal management, and cabin heating of HEVs. A control-oriented model of a power split HEV, including power and thermal loops, is developed and experimentally validated against data collected from a 2017 Toyota Prius HEV. Based on this model, the dynamic programming (DP) technique is adopted to derive a bench-mark for minimal fuel consumption, using 2-dimensional (power split and engine thermal management) and 3-dimensional (power split, engine thermal management, and cabin heating) formulations. Simulation results for a real-world congested driving cycle show that the engine thermal effect and the cabin heating requirement can significantly influence the optimal behavior for the power management, and substantial potential on fuel saving can be achieved by the i-PTM optimization as compared to conventional power and thermal management strategies.

While significant progress has been made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\varepsilon$, with query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\varepsilon$ and classical post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under severely constrained experimental access.

Thermal imaging, operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras. This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier, providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI) technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI modules-achieves a record 45\% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance characteristics are experimentally verified.

To address this, we present a framework that leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline. Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

We show a novel class of low-cost, passive LiDAR spoofing attacks that exploit mirror-like surfaces to inject or remove objects from an AV's perception. Using planar mirrors to redirect LiDAR beams, these attacks require no electronics or custom fabrication and can be deployed in real settings. We define two adversarial goals: Object Addition Attacks (OAA), which create phantom obstacles, and Object Removal Attacks (ORA), which conceal real hazards. We develop geometric optics models, validate them with controlled outdoor experiments using a commercial LiDAR and an Autoware-equipped vehicle, and implement a CARLA-based simulation for scalable testing. Experiments show mirror attacks corrupt occupancy grids, induce false detections, and trigger unsafe planning and control behaviors. We discuss potential defenses (thermal sensing, multi-sensor fusion, light-fingerprinting) and their limitations.

Considering the one-to-many relationship between structure and synthesis, we propose DiffSyn, a generative diffusion model trained on over 23,000 synthesis recipes spanning 50 years of literature. DiffSyn generates probable synthesis routes conditioned on a desired zeolite structure and an organic template. DiffSyn achieves state-of-the-art performance by capturing the multi-modal nature of structure-synthesis relationships. We apply DiffSyn to differentiate among competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a UFI material using DiffSyn-generated synthesis routes. These routes, rationalized by density functional theory binding energies, resulted in the successful synthesis of a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ of 19.0, which is expected to improve thermal stability and is higher than that of any previously recorded.

Despite its potential, applications of SciML in prognostics remain limited, partly due to the complexity of incorporating partial differential equations (PDEs) for ageing physics and the scarcity of robust uncertainty quantification methods. This work introduces a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework for probabilistic prognostics estimation. By embedding Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN architecture, the proposed approach produces principled, uncertainty-aware predictions. The method is applied to a transformer ageing case study, where insulation degradation is primarily driven by thermal stress. The heat diffusion PDE is used as the physical residual, and different prior distributions are investigated to examine their impact on predictive posterior distributions and their ability to encode a priori physical knowledge. The framework is validated against a finite element model developed and tested with real measurements from a solar power plant. Results, benchmarked against a dropout-PINN baseline, show that the proposed B-PINN delivers more reliable prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty. This capability is crucial for supporting robust and informed maintenance decision-making in critical power assets.

In this study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures, aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites, and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar (CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617, significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

By embedding heating elements within textile pneumatic chambers, the system delivers modulated pressure and thermal stimuli to fingerpads through a fully soft, wearable interface.
  Comprehensive characterization demonstrates rapid thermal modulation with heating rates up to 3$^{\circ}$C/s, enabling dynamic thermal feedback for virtual or teleoperation interactions. The pneumatic subsystem generates forces up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks. Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved force control precision (p = 0.013) when haptic feedback is enabled, validating the effectiveness of the integrated thermal-haptic approach for advanced human-machine interaction applications.

By treating time as an additional spatial dimension, we discretise the governing equations using a stabilised continuous Galerkin space-time finite element method. The resulting large all-at-once system is solved using an iterative Krylov solver preconditioned with a parallel space-time multigrid method employing a semi-coarsening strategy. Implemented in a fully parallel computing framework, the method yields a parallel-in-time method that demonstrates excellent scalability on a distributed-memory supercomputer, solving problems up to 4.2 billion degrees of freedom. Comparative studies show up to 52x speed-up over traditional time-stepping approaches, with only moderate increases in total computational cost in terms of core-hours. The framework is validated on benchmark problems with both time-constant and time-varying designs, and its flexibility is demonstrated through variations in material properties. These results establish the proposed space-time method as a promising approach for large-scale time-dependent topology optimisation in thermal applications.

This guarantees numerical well-posedness and exact preservation of conserved quantities, regardless of data sparsity or optimization error. The conditioning mechanism supports real-time calibration to parametric variables, allowing the construction of digital twins which support closed loop inference and calibration to sensor data. The framework interfaces with conventional finite element machinery in a non-invasive manner, allowing treatment of complex geometries and integration of learned models with conventional finite element techniques.
  Benchmarks include advection diffusion, shock hydrodynamics, electrostatics, and a complex battery thermal runaway problem. The method achieves accurate predictions on complex geometries with sparse data (25 LES simulations), including capturing the transition to turbulence and achieving real-time inference ~0.1s with a speedup of 3.1x10^8 relative to LES.

While traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41Â°C, while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18Â°C average change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable, fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban environments.

Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms: Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT (NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a 30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.

In this work, we introduce EMSpice 2.1, an enhanced tool built upon the existing coupled IR-EM analysis framework, EMSpice 2.0, for EM-aware IR drop analysis. For the first time, EMSpice 2.1 uniquely integrates Joule heating effects and practical thermal maps derived from actual chip conditions. Additionally, it features improved interoperability with commercial EDA tools, facilitating more comprehensive EM and IR drop sign-off analysis. Our findings demonstrate that specific hotspot patterns significantly impact the lifetime of interconnects and overall chip reliability due to EM failures. Furthermore, our tool exhibits strong agreement with industry-standard tools such as COMSOL, achieving a speedup of over 200 times while maintaining high accuracy.

A key requirement for these tasks is the ability to perform precise, contact-rich manipulation under significant uncertainty. In particular, thermal-induced deformation of manipulator links and temperature-dependent encoder bias introduce kinematic parameter errors that significantly degrade end-effector accuracy. Traditional calibration techniques rely on external sensors or dedicated calibration procedures, which can be infeasible or risky in dynamic, space-based operational scenarios.
  This paper proposes a novel method for kinematic parameter estimation that only requires encoder measurements and binary contact detection. The approach focuses on estimating link thermal deformation strain and joint encoder biases by leveraging information of the contact manifold - the set of relative SE(3) poses at which contact between the manipulator and environment occurs. We present two core contributions: (1) a differentiable, learning-based model of the contact manifold, and (2) an optimization-based algorithm for estimating kinematic parameters from encoder measurements at contact instances. By enabling parameter estimation using only encoder measurements and contact detection, this method provides a robust, interpretable, and data-efficient solution for safe and accurate manipulation in the challenging conditions of space.

This study introduces a physically guided neural framework that unifies temperature correction and image enhancement through a symmetric skip-CNN architecture and an emissivity-aware attention module. The pre-processing stage segments the ROIs of the image and and initially corrected the firing rate. A novel dual-constrained loss function strengthens the statistical consistency between the target and reference regions through mean-variance alignment and histogram matching based on Kullback-Leibler dispersion. The method works by dynamically fusing thermal radiation features and spatial context, and the model suppresses emissivity artifacts while recovering structural details. After validating the industrial blower system under different conditions, the improved network realizes the dynamic fusion of thermal radiation characteristics and spatial background, with accurate calibration results in various industrial conditions.

This study introduces thermal-gyro fusion, a novel sensor fusion approach that integrates ultra-low-resolution thermal imaging with gyroscope readings for rotational odometry. Unlike RGB cameras, thermal imaging is invariant to lighting conditions and, when fused with gyroscopic data, mitigates drift which is a common limitation of inertial sensors. We first develop a multimodal data acquisition system to collect synchronized thermal and gyroscope data, along with rotational speed labels, across diverse environments. Subsequently, we design and train a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that fuses both modalities for rotational speed estimation. Our analysis demonstrates that thermal-gyro fusion enables a significant reduction in thermal camera resolution without significantly compromising accuracy, thereby improving computational efficiency and memory utilization. These advantages make our approach well-suited for real-time deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems. Finally, to facilitate further research, we publicly release our dataset as supplementary material.

The YOLOv4-Tiny model was quantized to INT8 precision using TensorFlow Lite post-training quantization techniques and evaluated for detection speed, power consumption, and thermal feasibility under embedded deployment conditions. The quantized model achieved an inference time of 28.2 ms per image with an average power consumption of 13.85 W, demonstrating a significant reduction in power usage compared to its FP32 counterpart. Detection accuracy remained robust across key emergency classes such as Ambulance, Police, Fire Engine, and Car Crash.

In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective, Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous eigenvalue problems.

This model admits an extra conservation law for the total energy (first principle of thermodynamics) and satisfies the entropy inequality (second principle of thermodynamics). Furthermore, in the absence of algebraic source terms, the distortion field of the continuum and the specific thermal impulse satisfy a curl-free condition, provided the initial data are curl-free. Last but not least, the determinant of the distortion field is related to the density of the medium, i.e. the system is also endowed with a nonlinear algebraic constraint.
  The objective of this work is to construct and analyze a new semi-discrete thermodynamically compatible cell-centered Lagrangian finite volume scheme on moving unstructured meshes that satisfies the following structural properties of the governing PDE exactly at the discrete level: i) compatibility with the first law of thermodynamics, i.e. discrete total energy conservation; ii) compatibility with the second law of thermodynamics, i.e. discrete entropy inequality; iii) exact discrete compatibility between the density and the determinant of the distortion field; iv) exact preservation of the curl-free property of the distortion field and of the specific thermal impulse in the absence of algebraic source terms. We show that it is possible to achieve all above properties simultaneously. Unlike in existing schemes, we choose to directly discretize the entropy inequality, hence obtaining total energy conservation as a consequence of an appropriate and thermodynamically compatible discretization of all the other equations.

Traditional RGB-T detectors assume balanced training data, where both modalities contribute equally. However, in real-world scenarios, modality degradation-due to environmental factors or technical issues-can lead to extreme modality imbalance, causing out-of-distribution (OOD) issues during testing and disrupting model convergence during training. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel base-and-auxiliary detector architecture. We introduce a modality interaction module to adaptively weigh modalities based on their quality and handle imbalanced samples effectively. Additionally, we leverage modality pseudo-degradation to simulate real-world imbalances in training data. The base detector, trained on high-quality pairs, provides a consistency constraint for the auxiliary detector, which receives degraded samples. This framework enhances model robustness, ensuring reliable performance even under severe modality degradation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in handling extreme modality imbalances~(decreasing the Missing Rate by 55%) and improving performance across various baseline detectors.

When deployed in real-time applications, such as robotics and autonomous vehicles, these architectures must meet stringent timing constraints. To summarize these achievements, this article presents a comprehensive survey of real-time scheduling techniques for accelerator-based heterogeneous platforms. It highlights key advancements from the past ten years, showcasing how proposed solutions have evolved to address the distinct challenges and requirements of these systems.
  This survey begins with an overview of the hardware characteristics and common task execution models used in accelerator-based heterogeneous systems. It then categorizes the reviewed works based on soft and hard deadline constraints. For soft real-time approaches, we cover real-time scheduling methods supported by hardware vendors and strategies focusing on timing-critical scheduling, energy efficiency, and thermal-aware scheduling. For hard real-time approaches, we first examine support from processor vendors. We then discuss scheduling techniques that guarantee hard deadlines (with strict response time analysis). After reviewing general soft and hard real-time scheduling methods, we explore application- or scenario-driven real-time scheduling techniques for accelerator-enabled heterogeneous computing platforms. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of open issues and challenges within this research area.

The proposed methods use a pointwise smoother and uniform Cartesian space-time meshes. For problems with high contrast in the diffusivity, it was found that it is beneficial to define a coarsening strategy based on the geometric mean of the minimum and maximum diffusivity. However, other coarsening strategies may be better for other smoothers. Several methods of discretising the coarse levels were tested. Of these, it was best to use a method which averages the thermal resistivities on the finer levels. However, this was likely a consequence of the fact that only one spatial dimension was considered for the test problems. A second coarsening strategy was proposed which ensures spatial resolution on the coarse grids. Mixed results were found for this strategy. The proposed STMG methods were used as a solver for a one-dimensional topology optimisation problem. In this context, the adjoint problem was also solved using the STMG methods. The STMG methods were sufficiently robust for this application, since they converged during every optimisation cycle. It was found that the STMG methods also work for the adjoint problem when the prolongation operator only sends information forwards in time, even although the direction of time for the adjoint problem is backwards.

Most of the methods used to estimate the heating induced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials within the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this limitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and one-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. The proposed method is compared with measurements performed on a cranial mesh exposed to the magnetic field generated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging. Then, it is applied to a magnetic hyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial mesh is exposed to the magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic hyperthermia applicator for neck tumour treatment. The experimental comparison of the proposed method predictions and the measurement data shows an improved accuracy near the maximum temperature increase up to 25% with respect to the method based on thermal seeds. The application of the proposed method applied to the magnetic hyperthermia case study leads to a prediction of the maximum temperature increase that is 10% lower than the one overestimated by relying on thermal seeds. At the same time, the proposed method corrects the underestimation of the thermal seeds in the regions where the electromagnetic power is not directly deposited and the temperature increase is only due to heat transfer. The proposed method leads to improved results with respect to previous approximations by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly conductive metallic implants.

These codes efficiently simulate the progression of SAs, while they still have inherent limitations due to their inconsistent finite difference schemes. The use of empirical schemes incorporating both implicit and explicit formulations inherently induces unidirectional coupling in multi-physics analyses. The objective of this study is to develop a novel numerical method for TH system codes using physics-informed neural network (PINN). They have shown strength in solving multi-physics due to the innate feature of neural networks-automatic differentiation. We propose a node-assigned PINN (NA-PINN) that is suitable for the control volume approach-based system codes. NA-PINN addresses the issue of spatial governing equation variation by assigning an individual network to each nodalization of the system code, such that spatial information is excluded from both the input and output domains, and each subnetwork learns to approximate a purely temporal solution. In this phase, we evaluated the accuracy of the PINN methods for the hydrodynamic module. In the 6 water tank simulation, PINN and NA-PINN showed maximum absolute errors of 1.678 and 0.007, respectively. It should be noted that only NA-PINN demonstrated acceptable accuracy. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to successfully implement a system code using PINN. Our future work involves extending NA-PINN to a multi-physics solver and developing it in a surrogate manner.

To bring hidden truths to light, evidence at indoor crime scenes must be documented before any contamination or degradation occurs. Here, we address this challenge from the perspective of artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and robotics: Specifically, we explore the use of a blimp as a "floating camera" to drift over and record evidence with minimal disturbance. Adopting a rapid prototyping approach, we develop a proof-of-concept to investigate capabilities required for manual or semi-autonomous operation. Consequently, our results demonstrate the feasibility of equipping indoor blimps with various components (such as RGB and thermal cameras, LiDARs, and WiFi, with 20 minutes of battery life). Moreover, we confirm the core premise: that such blimps can be used to observe crime scene evidence while generating little airflow. We conclude by proposing some ideas related to detection (e.g., of bloodstains), mapping, and path planning, with the aim of stimulating further discussion and exploration.

Critical to achieving efficiency is tensor-parallel (TP; a form of MP) execution within tightly-coupled subsets of GPUs, referred to as a scale-up domain, and the larger the scale-up domain the better the performance. New datacenter architectures are emerging with more GPUs able to be tightly-coupled in a scale-up domain, such as moving from 8 GPUs to 72 GPUs connected via NVLink. Unfortunately, larger scale-up domains increase the blast-radius of failures, with a failure of single GPU potentially impacting TP execution on the full scale-up domain, which can degrade overall LLM training throughput dramatically. With as few as 0.1% of GPUs being in a failed state, a high TP-degree job can experience nearly 10% reduction in LLM training throughput. We propose nonuniform-tensor-parallelism (NTP) to mitigate this amplified impact of GPU failures. In NTP, a DP replica that experiences GPU failures operates at a reduced TP degree, contributing throughput equal to the percentage of still-functional GPUs. We also propose a rack-design with improved electrical and thermal capabilities in order to sustain power-boosting of scale-up domains that have experienced failures; combined with NTP, this can allow the DP replica with the reduced TP degree (i.e., with failed GPUs) to keep up with the others, thereby achieving near-zero throughput loss for large-scale LLM training.

This confers physical significance on the artificial numerical noise of DNS of the Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, DNS on a fine mesh should correspond to turbulence under small internal/external physical disturbance, whereas DNS on a sparse mesh corresponds to turbulent flow under large physical disturbance, respectively. The key point is that: all of them have physical meanings and so are correct in terms of their deterministic physics, even if their statistics are quite different. This is illustrated herein. Our paper provides a positive viewpoint regarding the presence of artificial numerical noise in DNS.

In this work, we apply data visualization and machine learning (ML) techniques to reveal unexpected correlations between composition, temperature, and material properties while using high throughput, in situ environmental photoluminescence (PL) experiments. Correlation heatmaps show the strong influence of Cs content on film degradation, and dimensionality reduction visualization methods uncover clear composition-based data clusters. An extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) effectively forecasts PL features for ten perovskite films with both composition-agnostic (>85% accuracy) and composition-dependent (>75% accuracy) model approaches, while elucidating the relative feature importance of composition (up to 99%). This model validates a previously unseen anti-correlation between Cs content and material thermal stability. Our ML-based framework can be expanded to any perovskite family, significantly reducing the analysis time currently employed to identify stable options for photovoltaics.

Sources of CtC heterogeneity include manufacturing process tolerances, poor module configurations, and inadequate thermal management. Understanding which CtC heterogeneity sources most significantly impact battery performance is crucial, as it can provide valuable insights. In this study, we use an experimentally validated electrochemical battery model to simulate hundreds of battery configurations, each consisting of four cells in parallel. We conduct a statistical analysis to evaluate the relative importance of key cell-level parameters, interconnection resistance, cell spacing, and location on performance and aging. The analysis reveals that heterogeneities in electrode active material volume fractions primarily impact module capacity, energy, and cell current, leading to substantial thermal gradients. However, to fully capture the output behavior, interconnection resistance, state of charge gradients and the effect of the temperature on parameter values must also be considered. Additionally, module design configurations, particularly cell location, exacerbate thermal gradients, accelerating long-term module degradation. This study also offers insights into optimizing cell arrangement during module design to reduce thermal gradients and enhance overall battery performance and longevity. Simulation results with four cells indicate a reduction of 51.8% in thermal gradients, leading to a 5.2% decrease in long-term energy loss.

Yet current thermal feedback devices, heavily influenced by the needs of virtual reality, often hinder physical interactions and are ineffective for immersion in AR. To bridge this gap, we have identified three design considerations relevant for AR thermal feedback: indirect feedback to maintain dexterity, thermal passthrough to preserve real-world temperature perception, and spatiotemporal rendering for dynamic sensations. We then created a unique and innovative thermal feedback device that satisfies these criteria. Human subject experiments assessing perceptual sensitivity, object temperature matching, spatial pattern recognition, and moving thermal stimuli demonstrated the impact of our design, enabling realistic temperature discrimination, virtual object perception, and enhanced immersion. These findings demonstrate that carefully designed thermal feedback systems can bridge the sensory gap between physical and virtual interactions, enhancing AR realism and usability.

Task replication can improve reliability by duplicating a task's execution to handle transient and permanent faults, but blindly applying replication often leads to excessive overhead and higher temperatures. Existing design-time methods typically choose the number of replicas based on worst-case conditions, which can waste resources under normal operation. In this paper, we present RL-TIME, a reinforcement learning-based approach that dynamically decides the number of replicas according to actual system conditions. By considering both the reliability target and a core-level Thermal Safe Power (TSP) constraint at run-time, RL-TIME adapts the replication strategy to avoid unnecessary overhead and overheating. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, RL-TIME reduces power consumption by 63%, increases schedulability by 53%, and respects TSP 72% more often.

The existing measurement-based methods often generate noisy signals and cannot scale up for large-scale battery packs. The electrochemical model-based methods, on the contrary, offer high accuracy but are computationally expensive. To tackle these issues, inspired by the equivalentcircuit voltage model for batteries, this paper presents a novel equivalent-circuit electro-thermal model (ECTM) for modeling battery surface temperature. By approximating the complex heat generation inside batteries with data-driven nonlinear (polynomial) functions of key measurable parameters such as state-of-charge (SOC), current, and terminal voltage, our ECTM is simplified into a linear form that admits rapid solutions. Such simplified ECTM can be readily identified with one single (one-shot) cycle data. The proposed model is extensively validated with benchmark NASA, MIT, and Oxford battery datasets. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the model, despite being identified with one-shot cycle data, in predicting battery temperatures robustly under different battery degradation status and ambient conditions.

Emphasizing the pre-register-transfer level (Pre-RTL) design phase is crucial for reducing trial-and-error costs. However, 3DIC design introduces additional complexities due to thermal constraints and an expanded design space resulting from vertical stacking and various cooling strategies. Despite this need, existing Pre-RTL DSE tools for 3DICs remain scarce, with available solutions often lacking comprehensive design options and full customization support. To bridge this gap, we present Cool-3D, an end-to-end, thermal-aware framework for 3DIC design that integrates mainstream architectural-level simulators, including gem5, McPAT, and HotSpot 7.0, with advanced cooling models. Cool-3D enables broad and fine-grained design space exploration, built-in microfluidic cooling support for thermal analysis, and an extension interface for non-parameterizable customization, allowing designers to model and optimize 3DIC architectures with greater flexibility and accuracy. To validate the Cool-3D framework, we conduct three case studies demonstrating its ability to model various hardware design options and accurately capture thermal behaviors. Cool-3D serves as a foundational framework that not only facilitates comprehensive 3DIC design space exploration but also enables future innovations in 3DIC architecture, cooling strategies, and optimization techniques. The entire framework, along with the experimental data, is in the process of being released on GitHub.

Transport and absorption of particles in radiative transfer at different rates lead to a complex interaction between the material and particles that involves highly varying time scales. Resolving these effects can require prohibitively small step sizes, which, combined with nonlinear effects and the particle density's high-dimensional phase space, render conventional numerical methods computationally expensive. This work presents an asymptotic--preserving, mass conservative, rank-adaptive, and parallel integrator for a macro--micro decomposition-based dynamical low-rank approximation of the thermal radiative transfer equations. The proposed integrator efficiently incorporates reflection-transmission type boundary conditions in the low-rank factors. It captures the nonlinear effects of thermal radiation and is energy stable with the step size restriction capturing both hyperbolic and parabolic CFL conditions. The efficacy of the proposed integrator is demonstrated with numerical experiments.

In many cases, when state vector $x$ does not majorize state vector $y$, it is nevertheless possible to find a catalyst - another vector $z$ such that $x \otimes z$ majorizes $y \otimes z$. Determining the feasibility of such catalytic transformation typically involves checking an infinite set of inequalities. Here, we derive a finite sufficient set of inequalities that imply catalysis. Extending this framework to thermodynamics, we also establish a finite set of sufficient conditions for catalytic state transformations under thermal operations. For novel examples, we provide a software toolbox implementing these conditions.

While traditional methods, such as analytical models and metrology, laid the groundwork for geometric precision, they are often impractical for large-scale production. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have improved compensation precision, but issues remain in generalizing across complex geometries and adapting to position-dependent variations. We present a novel approach for powder bed fusion (PBF) processes, using GraphCompNet, which is a computational framework combining graph-based neural networks with a generative adversarial network (GAN)-inspired training process. By leveraging point cloud data and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs), GraphCompNet models complex shapes and incorporates position-specific thermal and mechanical factors. A two-stage adversarial training procedure iteratively refines compensated designs via a compensator-predictor architecture, offering real-time feedback and optimization. Experimental validation across diverse shapes and positions shows the framework significantly improves compensation accuracy (35 to 65 percent) across the entire print space, adapting to position-dependent variations. This work advances the development of Digital Twin technology for AM, enabling scalable, real-time monitoring and compensation, and addressing critical gaps in AM process control. The proposed method supports high-precision, automated industrial-scale design and manufacturing systems.

The model aims to identify non-dominant capacity allocation schemes for heat pumps, thermal energy storage, electric boilers, and combined storage heaters to construct a Pareto front, considering both economic and sustainable objectives. The integration of various heat sources from both generation and consumption sides enhances flexibility in utilization. The study introduces a novel optimization algorithm, the adaptive multi-objective Bayesian optimization (AMBO). Compared to other widely used multi-objective optimization algorithms, AMBO eliminates predefined parameters that may introduce subjectivity from planners. Beyond the algorithm, the proposed model incorporates a noise term to account for inevitable simulation deviations, enabling the identification of better-performing planning results that meet the unique requirements of cold regions. What's more, the characteristics of electric-thermal coupling scenarios are captured and reflected in the operation simulation model to make sure the simulation is close to reality. Numerical simulation verifies the superiority of the proposed approach in generating a more diverse and evenly distributed Pareto front in a sample-efficient manner, providing comprehensive and objective planning choices.

Existing methods typically employ a two-branch encoder framework for multimodal feature extraction and design complicated feature fusion strategies to achieve feature extraction and fusion for multimodal semantic segmentation. However, these methods require massive parameter updates and computational effort during the feature extraction and fusion. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal fusion network (EFNet) based on an early fusion strategy and a simple but effective feature clustering for training efficient RGB-T semantic segmentation. In addition, we also propose a lightweight and efficient multi-scale feature aggregation decoder based on Euclidean distance. We validate the effectiveness of our method on different datasets and outperform previous state-of-the-art methods with lower parameters and computation.

The TSEP method comprises three key processes: calibration, regression, and application. While significant efforts have been devoted to improving regression algorithms and increasing TSEP sensitivity to enhance junction temperature monitoring accuracy, these approaches have reached a bottleneck. In reality, the calibration method significantly influences monitoring accuracy, an aspect often overlooked in conventional TSEP methods. To address this issue, we propose a high-accuracy calibration method for transient TSEPs. First, a temperature compensation strategy based on thermal analysis is introduced to mitigate the temperature difference caused by load current during dual pulse tests. Second, the impact of stray parameters is analyzed to identify coupled parameters, which are typically neglected in existing methods. Third, it is observed that random errors follow a logarithm Gaussian distribution, covering a hidden variable. A neural network is used to obtain the junction temperature predictive model. The proposed calibration method is experimental validated in threshold voltage as an example. Compared with conventional calibration methods, the mean absolute error is reduced by over 30%. Moreover, this method does not require additional hardware cost and has good generalization.

The algorithm leverages the latent space of a generative model for rapid sampling and employs a Pearson correlated surrogate model to predict the figure of merit of the true design metric. As a showcase example, PearSAN is applied to thermophotovoltaic (TPV) metasurface design by matching the working bands between a thermal radiator and a photovoltaic cell. PearSAN can work with any pretrained generative model with a discretized latent space, making it easy to integrate with VQ-VAEs and binary autoencoders. Its novel Pearson correlational loss can be used as both a latent regularization method, similar to batch and layer normalization, and as a surrogate training loss. We compare both to previous energy matching losses, which are shown to enforce poor regularization and performance, even with upgraded affine parameters. PearSAN achieves a state-of-the-art maximum design efficiency of 97%, and is at least an order of magnitude faster than previous methods, with an improved maximum figure-of-merit gain.

Modeling and simulation offer cost-effective tools for designing strategies to mitigate thermal runaway. Accurately simulating the chemical kinetics of thermal runaway, commonly represented by systems of Arrhenius-based Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), requires fitting kinetic parameters to experimental calorimetry data, such as Accelerating Rate Calorimetry (ARC) measurements. However, existing fitting methods often rely on empirical assumptions and simplifications that compromise generality or require manual tuning during the fitting process. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) offers a promising approach for directly fitting kinetic parameters to experimental data. Yet, for systems created by multiple Arrhenius ODEs, the computational cost of fitting using a brute-force approach that searches the entire parameter space simultaneously can become prohibitive. This work introduces a divide-and-conquer approach based on PSO to fit N-equation Arrhenius ODE models to ARC data. The proposed method achieves more accurate parameter fitting compared to the brute-force method while maintaining low computational costs. The method is analyzed using two distinct ARC datasets, and the resulting models are further validated through simulations of 3D ARC and oven tests, showing excellent agreement with experimental data and alignment with expected trends.

However, the fill volume of coolant and PCM in hybrid cooling systems is limited by the size and weight of the HBTMS at high charge/discharge rates. These limitations result in reduced convective heat transfer from the coolant during discharge. The liquefaction rate of PCM is accelerated and the passive cooling effect is reduced. In this paper, we propose a compact hybrid cooling system with multi-inlet U-shaped microchannels for which the gap between channels is embedded by PCM/aluminum foam for compactness. Nanofluid cooling (NC) technology with better thermal conductivity is used. A pulsed flow function is further developed for enhanced cooling (EC) with reduced power consumption. An experimentally validated thermal-fluid dynamics model is developed to optimize operating conditions including coolant type, cooling direction, channel height, inlet flow rate, and cooling scheme. The results show that the hybrid cooling solution of NC+PCM+EC adopted by HBTMS further reduces the maximum temperature of the Li-ion battery by 3.44Â°C under a discharge rate of 1C at room temperature of 25Â°C with only a 5% increase in power consumption, compared to the conventional liquid cooling method for electric vehicles (EV). The average number of battery charges has increased by about 6 to 15 percent. The results of this study can help improve the range as well as driving safety of new energy EV.

Current techniques for mitigating large spectral disparities between RGB and IR imagery often include learning a discriminative common subspace by exploiting precisely curated data acquired from multiple spectra. Although there are challenges with determining robust architectures for extracting common information, a critical limitation for supervised methods is poor scalability in terms of acquiring labeled data. Therefore, we propose a novel unsupervised cross-spectral framework that combines (1) a new pseudo triplet loss with cross-spectral voting, (2) a new cross-spectral attention network leveraging multiple subspaces, and (3) structured sparsity to perform more discriminative cross-spectral clustering. We extensively compare our proposed RGB-IR biometric learning framework (and its individual components) with recent and previous state-of-the-art models on two challenging benchmark datasets: DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory Visible-Thermal Face Dataset (ARL-VTF) and RegDB person re-identification dataset, and, in some cases, achieve performance superior to completely supervised methods.

This paper explores the information geometry of these states, focusing on characterizing the distance between two nearby states and the geometry induced by a parameterization in terms of their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. In particular, for the family of bosonic Gaussian thermal states, we derive expressions for their Fisher-Bures and Kubo-Mori information matrices with respect to their mean vectors and Hamiltonian matrices. An important application of our formulas consists of fundamental limits on how well one can estimate these parameters. We additionally establish formulas for the derivatives and the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. The former could have applications in gradient descent algorithms for quantum machine learning when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz, and the latter in formulating optimal strategies for single parameter estimation of bosonic Gaussian thermal states. Finally, the expressions for the aforementioned information matrices could have additional applications in natural gradient descent algorithms when using bosonic Gaussian thermal states as an ansatz.

This paper studies grid-level coordinated control of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) for scalable and optimal frequency control. We propose a fully distributed optimal frequency control algorithm based on the projected primal-dual gradient method and by leveraging the structure of the underlying physical system dynamics. The proposed algorithm i) restores the nominal system frequency while minimizing total control cost and enforcing IBR power capacity limits and line thermal constraints, and ii) operates in a distributed manner that only needs local measurements and neighbor-to-neighbor communication. In particular, when the line thermal constraints are disregarded, the proposed algorithm admits a fully local implementation that requires no communication, while still ensuring optimality and satisfying IBR power capacity limits. We establish the global asymptotic convergence of the algorithm using Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and optimality of the proposed algorithms are validated through high-fidelity, 100% inverter-based electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.

To address these limitations, physical neural networks (PNNs), which use physical substrates for computation, have gained increasing attention. However, developing effective training methods for PNNs remains a significant challenge. Current approaches, regardless of offline and online training, suffer from significant accuracy loss. Offline training is hindered by imprecise modeling, while online training yields device-specific models that can't be transferred to other devices due to manufacturing variances. Both methods face challenges from perturbations after deployment, such as thermal drift or alignment errors, which make trained models invalid and require retraining. Here, we address the challenges with both offline and online training through a novel technique called Sharpness-Aware Training (SAT), where we innovatively leverage the geometry of the loss landscape to tackle the problems in training physical systems. SAT enables accurate training using efficient backpropagation algorithms, even with imprecise models. PNNs trained by SAT offline even outperform those trained online, despite modeling and fabrication errors. SAT also overcomes online training limitations by enabling reliable transfer of models between devices. Finally, SAT is highly resilient to perturbations after deployment, allowing PNNs to continuously operate accurately under perturbations without retraining. We demonstrate SAT across three types of PNNs, showing it is universally applicable, regardless of whether the models are explicitly known. This work offers a transformative, efficient approach to training PNNs, addressing critical challenges in analog computing and enabling real-world deployment.

By means of a ``thought experiment'' via several clean numerical experiments based on the Navier-Stokes equations for two-dimensional turbulent Kolmogorov flow, we reveal a new phenomenon, which we call the ``noise-expansion cascade'' whereby all micro-level noises/disturbances at different orders of magnitudes in the initial condition of Navier-Stokes equations enlarge consistently, say, one by one like an inverse cascade, to macro-level. More importantly, each noise/disturbance input may greatly change the macro-level characteristics and statistics of the resulting turbulence, clearly indicating that micro-level noise/disturbance might have great influence on macro-level characteristics and statistics of turbulence. Besides, the noise-expansion cascade closely connects randomness of micro-level noise/disturbance and macro-level disorder of turbulence, thus revealing an origin of randomness of turbulence. This also highly suggests that unavoidable thermal fluctuations must be considered when simulating turbulence, even if such fluctuations are several orders of magnitudes smaller than other external environmental disturbances. Hopefully, the ``noise-expansion cascade'' as a fundamental property of the NS equations could greatly deepen our understandings about turbulence, and besides is helpful for attacking the fourth millennium problem posed by Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000.

Inevitably, uncertainties arise, and Bayesian methods provide a robust framework for quantifying and propagating these uncertainties to model predictions. Nevertheless, Bayesian methods paired with inexact models usually produce predictions unable to represent the observed datapoints. Additionally, the quantified uncertainties of these overconfident models cannot be propagated to other Quantities of Interest (QoIs) reliably. A promising solution involves embedding a model inadequacy term in the inference parameters, allowing the quantified model form uncertainty to influence non-observed QoIs. This paper introduces a more interpretable framework for embedding the model inadequacy compared to existing methods. To overcome the limitations of current approaches, we adapt the existing likelihood models to properly account for noise in the measurements and propose two new formulations designed to address their shortcomings. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of this inadequacy-embedding approach in the presence of discrepancies between measurements and model predictions, including noise and outliers. Particular attention is given to how the uncertainty associated with the model inadequacy term propagates to the QoIs, enabling a more comprehensive statistical analysis of prediction's reliability. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to estimate the uncertainty in the predicted heat flux from a transient thermal simulation using temperature observations.

It remains under-explored, however, how these multiple modalities ought to be fused in a deep learning model. As a step towards filling this gap, we study three strategies (Early fusion, Late fusion, and Mixture of Experts) for fusing thermal, RGB, and LiDAR imagery using a dataset of spatially-aligned orthomosaics in these three modalities. In particular, we aim to map three ecologically-relevant biophysical landscape features in African savanna ecosystems: rhino middens, termite mounds, and water. The three fusion strategies differ in whether the modalities are fused early or late, and if late, whether the model learns fixed weights per modality for each class or generates weights for each class adaptively, based on the input. Overall, the three methods have similar macro-averaged performance with Late fusion achieving an AUC of 0.698, but their per-class performance varies strongly, with Early fusion achieving the best recall for middens and water and Mixture of Experts achieving the best recall for mounds.

The lower-cost and real-time nature of ultrasound (US) has advantages over computed tomography (CT) for applicator guidance, however, in some patients, liver tumors may be occult on US and tumor mimics can make lesion identification challenging. Image registration techniques can aid in interpreting anatomical details and identifying tumors, but their clinical application has been hindered by the tradeoff between alignment accuracy and runtime performance, particularly when compensating for liver motion due to patient breathing or movement. Therefore, we propose a 2D-3D US registration approach to enable intra-procedural alignment that mitigates errors caused by liver motion. Specifically, our approach can correlate imbalanced 2D and 3D US image features and use continuous 6D rotation representations to enhance the model's training stability. The dataset was divided into 2388, 196 and 193 image pairs for training, validation and testing, respectively. Our approach achieved a mean Euclidean distance error of 2.28 mm $\pm$ 1.81 mm and a mean geodesic angular error of 2.99$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 1.95$^{\circ}$, with a runtime of 0.22 seconds per 2D-3D US image pair. These results demonstrate that our approach can achieve accurate alignment and clinically acceptable runtime, indicating potential for clinical translation.

In the context of heating systems in the buildings, optimizing the energy efficiency while maintaining the residents' thermal comfort can be intuitively formulated as a constrained optimization problem. However, to solve it with RL may require large amount of data. Therefore, an accurate and versatile simulator is favored. In this paper, we propose a novel building simulator I4B which provides interfaces for different usages and apply a model-free constrained RL algorithm named constrained Soft Actor-Critic with Linear Smoothed Log Barrier function (CSAC-LB) to the heating optimization problem. Benchmarking against baseline algorithms demonstrates CSAC-LB's efficiency in data exploration, constraint satisfaction and performance.

In this paper, an enhanced semidefinite relaxation model that integrates tighter Î»-based quadratic convex relaxation, valid inequalities, and optimality-based bound tightening algorithms derived in accordance with the branch thermal limit boundary surface into the SDP framework is presented to further tighten the lower bounds of the feasible region of OPF problems, effectively combining the advantages of these recent advancements. Additionally, the utilization of chordal decomposition in the complex matrix formulation of SDP can significantly accelerate the solution time. Notably, for the same SDP problem, different chordal decompositions can result in varying solution time. To address this problem, this paper proposes a clique graph merging strategy within the complex matrix SDP framework, which assesses clique sizes and the computational burden on interior-point solvers, as well as reducing the need for hyperparameter tuning and further enhancing the solution efficiency. Finally, the proposed hybrid relaxation model is evaluated using MATPOWER and PGLib-OPF test cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the optimality gap and validating its computational performance on test cases with up to 13659-node.

Offline (that is, during cycle planning and core design), a three dimensional neutronics simulator is used to estimate the reactor's power, moderator, void, and flow distributions, from which margin to thermal limits and fuel exposures can be approximated. Online, this is accomplished with a system of local power range monitors (LPRMs) designed to capture enough neutron flux information to infer the full nodal power distribution. Certain problems with this process, ranging from measurement and calibration to the power adaption process, pose challenges to operators and limit the ability to design reload cores economically (e.g., engineering in insufficient margin or more margin than required). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being used to solve the problems to reduce maintenance costs, improve the accuracy of online local power measurements, and decrease the bias between offline and online power distributions, thereby leading to a greater ability to design safe and economical reload cores. We present ML models trained from two deep neural network (DNN) architectures, SurrogateNet and LPRMNet, that demonstrate a testing error of 1 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Applications of these models can include virtual sensing capability for bypassed or malfunctioning LPRMs, on demand virtual calibration of detectors between successive calibrations, highly accurate nuclear end of life determinations for LPRMs, and reduced bias between measured and predicted power distributions within the core.

Progressively, these networked systems began interacting, forming what is now known as systems-of-systems. Because the component systems in the system-of-systems differ, modeling and analysis techniques with primitives applicable across multiple domains or disciplines are needed. For example, linear graphs and bond graphs have been used extensively in the electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and mechatronic fields to design and analyze a wide variety of engineering systems. In contrast, hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT) has emerged to study many complex engineering systems and systems-of-systems (e.g. electric power, potable water, wastewater, natural gas, oil, coal, multi-modal transportation, mass-customized production, and personalized healthcare delivery systems). This paper seeks to relate hetero-functional graphs to linear graphs and bond graphs and demonstrate that the former is a generalization of the latter two. The contribution is relayed in three stages. First, the three modeling techniques are compared conceptually. Next, these techniques are contrasted on six example systems: (a) an electrical system, (b) a translational mechanical system, (c) a rotational mechanical system, (d) a fluidic system, (e) a thermal system, and (f) a multi-energy (electro-mechanical) system. Finally, this paper proves mathematically that hetero-functional graphs are a formal generalization of both linear graphs and bond graphs.

However, these trackers often either overlook temporal information or fail to fully utilize it, resulting in an ineffective balance between multi-modal and temporal information. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross Fusion RGB-T Tracking architecture (CFBT) that ensures the full participation of multiple modalities in tracking while dynamically fusing temporal information. The effectiveness of CFBT relies on three newly designed cross spatio-temporal information fusion modules: Cross Spatio-Temporal Augmentation Fusion (CSTAF), Cross Spatio-Temporal Complementarity Fusion (CSTCF), and Dual-Stream Spatio-Temporal Adapter (DSTA). CSTAF employs a cross-attention mechanism to enhance the feature representation of the template comprehensively. CSTCF utilizes complementary information between different branches to enhance target features and suppress background features. DSTA adopts the adapter concept to adaptively fuse complementary information from multiple branches within the transformer layer, using the RGB modality as a medium. These ingenious fusions of multiple perspectives introduce only less than 0.3\% of the total modal parameters, but they indeed enable an efficient balance between multi-modal and temporal information. Extensive experiments on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Thermal runaway in batteries leads to an uncontrollable temperature rise and potentially fires, which is a major safety concern. Typically, when modelling the chemical kinetics of thermal runaway calorimetry data ( e.g. Accelerating Rate Calorimetry (ARC)) is needed to determine the temperature-driven decomposition kinetics. Conventional methods of fitting Arrhenius Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) thermal runaway models to Accelerated Rate Calorimetry (ARC) data make several assumptions that reduce the fidelity and generalizability of the obtained model. In this paper, Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (CRNNs) are trained to fit the kinetic parameters of N-equation Arrhenius ODEs to ARC data obtained from a Molicel 21700 P45B. The models are found to be better approximations of the experimental data. The flexibility of the method is demonstrated by experimenting with two-equation and four-equation models. Thermal runaway simulations are conducted in 3D using the obtained kinetic parameters, showing the applicability of the obtained thermal runaway models to large-scale simulations.

By deploying AM processes on the end effectors of multiple robotic arms, not only are traditional constraints such as limited build volumes circumvented, but systems also achieve accelerated fabrication speeds, cooperative sensing capabilities, and in-situ multi-material deposition. Despite advancements, challenges remain, particularly regarding defect generation including voids, cracks, and residual stress. Various factors contribute to these issues, including toolpath planning (i.e., slicing strategies), part decomposition for cooperative printing, and motion planning (i.e., path and trajectory planning). This review first examines the critical aspects of system control for C-RAM systems comprised of slicing and motion planning. The methods for the mitigation of defects through the adjustment of these aspects and the process parameters of AM methods are then described in the context of how they modify the AM process: pre-process, inter-layer (i.e., during layer pauses), and mid-layer (i.e., during material deposition). The application of advanced sensing technologies, including high-resolution cameras, laser scanners, and thermal imaging, to facilitate the capture of micro, meso, and macro-scale defects is explored. The role of digital twins is analyzed, emphasizing their capability to simulate and predict manufacturing outcomes, enabling preemptive adjustments to prevent defects. Finally, the outlook and future opportunities for developing next-generation C-RAM systems are outlined.

Nevertheless,the efficacy of thermal vision algorithms driven by deep learning models remains constrained by the paucity of available training data samples. To this end,this paper introduces a novel approach termed the edge guided conditional diffusion model. This framework aims to produce meticulously aligned pseudo thermal images at the pixel level,leveraging edge information extracted from visible images. By utilizing edges as contextual cues from the visible domain,the diffusion model achieves meticulous control over the delineation of objects within the generated images. To alleviate the impacts of those visible-specific edge information that should not appear in the thermal domain,a two-stage modality adversarial training strategy is proposed to filter them out from the generated images by differentiating the visible and thermal modality. Extensive experiments on LLVIP demonstrate ECDM s superiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of image generation quality.

Crucially, the performance of such strategies is sensitive to various algorithm design choices. In this work, we develop a framework for implementing model predictive controls on residential water heaters for load shifting applications. We use this framework to analyze how four different design factors affect control performance and thermal comfort: (i) control model fidelity, (ii) temperature sensor configuration, (iii) water draw estimation methodology, and (iv) water draw forecasting methodology. We propose new methods for estimating water draw patterns without the use of a flow meter. MPC strategies are compared under two different time-varying price signals through simulations using a high-fidelity tank model and real-world draw data. Results show that control model fidelity and the number of temperature sensors have the largest impact on electricity costs, while the water draw forecasting methodology has a significant impact on thermal comfort and the frequency of runout events. Results provide practical insight into effective MPC design for water heaters in home energy management systems.

Its thermal management needs to effectively control active components across varying operating conditions. While robust control function parametrization is required, current methodologies show significant drawbacks. They consume considerable time, human effort, and extensive real-world testing. Consequently, there is a need for innovative and intelligent solutions that are capable of autonomously parametrizing embedded controllers. Addressing this issue, our paper introduces a learning-based tuning approach. We propose a methodology that benefits from automated scenario generation for increased robustness across vehicle usage scenarios. Our deep reinforcement learning agent processes the tuning task context and incorporates an image-based interpretation of embedded parameter sets. We demonstrate its applicability to a valve controller parametrization task and verify it in real-world vehicle testing. The results highlight the competitive performance to baseline methods. This novel approach contributes to the shift towards virtual development of thermal management functions, with promising potential of large-scale parameter tuning in the automotive industry.

A new Higher-Order Super Compact (HOSC) finite difference scheme is used to analyze the thermal behavior under both heating scenarios. After the quantitative and qualitative validations, the computed results are analyzed for a range of Hartman number ($Ha = 25, 50, 100, 150$) and Rayleigh number ($Ra = 10^3, 10^4, 10^5$) with fixed $Pr=0.065$ (molten lithium). Three distinct heating scenarios, i.e., uniform heating ($T_h = 1$), $y$-dependent non-uniform heating ($T_h = sin(Ïy$)), and a combination of $y$ and $z$-dependent non-uniform heating ($T_h = sin(Ïy)sin(Ïz)$) are investigated on the left wall ($x=0$) of the cubic cavity. It is found that variations in the $Ha$ and $Ra$, along with distinct thermal boundary conditions, exert significant effects on both the temperature distribution and flow field inside the 3D cubical cavity. Specifically, an increase in $Ra$ corresponds to enhanced heat transfer, highlighting the dominance of convection. Conversely, an increase in $Ha$ leads to a reduction in heat transfer due to the deceleration of fluid velocity. The scenario in which walls are uniformly heated exhibits the most significant total entropy generation. It is observed that with an increase in the $Ra$, the Bejan number ($Be$) decreases, which ultimately leads to an increase in total entropy generation. The implementation of the new HOSC scheme in this analysis showcases its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of 3D MHD-driven natural convection and entropy generation. This study offers significant information that might help improve the optimization and design of relevant engineering systems. Thus, our work stands out as genuinely novel and pioneering in its approach.

While these conditions represent a consistent impact on the transmission lines, certain unpredictable conditions such as unexpected high wind, wildfire, and icing pose catastrophic risks to the reliability and integrity of the transmission lines. These factors in the presence of initial damage and electrical loads greatly affect the material properties. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive thermo-electro-mechanical model to investigate the long-term effect of unexpected high wind, wildfire, and ice on transmission lines. This study offers an in-depth perspective on temperature and damage evolution within the power lines by incorporating a phase field model for damage and fatigue, alongside thermal and electrical models. We define a state function to assess the failure, considering damage and temperature. We study three scenarios deterministically to establish a basic understanding and analyze the stochastic behavior using the Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM). We utilize PCM for forward uncertainty quantification, conducting sensitivity analysis, and evaluating the probability of failure. This approach offers an in-depth examination of the potential risks associated with transmission lines under unfavorable circumstances.

Controlling spontaneous emission is crucial for clean-energy solutions in illumination, thermal radiation engineering, and remote sensing. Despite the potential of reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces with embedded sources for spatiotemporal control, achieving arbitrary far-field control remains challenging. Here, we present a self-driving lab (SDL) platform that addresses this challenge by discovering the governing equations for predicting the far-field emission profile from light-emitting metasurfaces. We discover that both the spatial gradient (grating-like) and the curvature (lens-like) of the local refractive index are key factors in steering spontaneous emission. The SDL employs a machine-learning framework comprising: (1) a variational autoencoder for generating complex spatial refractive index profiles, (2) an active learning agent for guiding experiments with real-time closed-loop feedback, and (3) a neural network-based equation learner to uncover structure-property relationships. The SDL demonstrated a four-fold enhancement in peak emission directivity (up to 77%) over a 72Â° field of view within ~300 experiments. Our findings reveal that combinations of positive gratings and lenses are as effective as negative lenses and gratings for all emission angles, offering a novel strategy for controlling spontaneous emission beyond conventional Fourier optics.

Human organ motions, such as those in the liver, exhibit rhythmic components influenced by respiratory and cardiac cycles, making effective laser energy delivery to target lesions while compensating for tumor motion crucial. This research introduces a data-driven method to derive surrogate models of a soft manipulator. These low-dimensional models offer computational efficiency when integrated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, while still capturing the manipulator's dynamics with and without control input. Spectral Submanifolds (SSM) theory models the manipulator's autonomous dynamics, acknowledging its tendency to reach equilibrium when external forces are removed. Preliminary results show that the MPC controller using the surrogate model outperforms two other models within the same MPC framework. The data-driven MPC controller also supports a design-agnostic feature, allowing the interchangeability of different soft manipulators within the laser ablation surgery robot system.

This study focuses on the reliability of transmission lines, specifically examining the effects of wind, ambient temperature, and current demands on lines, incorporating minimal and significant pre-existing damage. We develop a Thermo-Electro-Mechanical Model to analyze the transmission line failures across sensitive and affected states of the United States, integrating historical data on wind and ambient temperature. By combining numerical simulation with historical data analysis, our research assesses the impact of varying environmental conditions on the reliability of transmission lines. Our methodology begins with a deterministic approach to model temperature and damage evolution, using phase-field modeling for fatigue and damage, coupled with electrical and thermal models. Later, we adopt the Probability Collocation Method to investigate the stochastic behavior of the system, enhancing our understanding of uncertainties in model parameters, conducting sensitivity analysis, and estimating the probability of failures over time. This approach allows for a comprehensive analysis of factors affecting transmission line reliability, contributing valuable insights into improving power line's resilience against environmental conditions.

Among the power grid components, transmission lines are critical due to exposure and vulnerability to severe external conditions, including high winds, ice, and extreme temperatures. The combined effects of external agents with high electrical load and presence of damage precursors greatly affects the conducting material's properties due to a thermal runaway cycle that accelerates the aging process. In this paper, we develop a thermo-electro-mechanical model for long-term failure analysis of overhead transmission lines. A phase-field model of damage and fatigue, coupled with electrical and thermal modules, provides a detailed description of the conductor's temperature evolution. We define a limit state function based on maximum operating temperature to avoid excessive overheating and sagging. We study four representative scenarios deterministically, and propose the Probabilistic Collocation Method (PCM) as a tool to understand the stochastic behavior of the system. We use PCM in forward parametric uncertainty quantification, global sensitivity analysis, and computation of failure probability curves in a straightforward and computationally efficient fashion, and we quantify the most influential parameters that affect the failure predictability from a physics-based perspective.

Utilizing low-cost thermal cameras can lower the barrier to introducing thermal imaging in agricultural research and production. This paper presents an approach to improve the temperature accuracy and image quality of low-cost thermal imaging cameras for agricultural applications. Leveraging advancements in computer vision techniques, particularly deep learning networks, we propose a method, called $\textbf{VisTA-SR}$ ($\textbf{Vis}$ual \& $\textbf{T}$hermal $\textbf{A}$lignment and $\textbf{S}$uper-$\textbf{R}$esolution Enhancement) that combines RGB and thermal images to enhance the capabilities of low-resolution thermal cameras. The research includes calibration and validation of temperature measurements, acquisition of paired image datasets, and the development of a deep learning network tailored for agricultural thermal imaging. Our study addresses the challenges of image enhancement in the agricultural domain and explores the potential of low-cost thermal cameras to replace high-resolution industrial cameras. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temperature accuracy and image sharpness, paving the way for more accessible and efficient thermal imaging solutions in agriculture.

However, effectively exploiting the complementarity between RGB-T modals while maintaining efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this paper, a very simple Group Shuffled Multi-receptive Attention (GSMA) module is proposed to extract and combine multi-scale RGB and thermal features. Then, the extracted multi-modal features are directly integrated with a multi-level path aggregation neck, which significantly improves the fusion effect and efficiency. Meanwhile, multi-modal object detection often adopts union annotations for both modals. This kind of supervision is not sufficient and unfair, since objects observed in one modal may not be seen in the other modal. To solve this issue, Multi-modal Supervision (MS) is proposed to sufficiently supervise RGB-T object detection. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks, KAIST and DroneVehicle, demonstrate the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining competitive efficiency.

This growing problem has brought the environmental sustainability of AI technologies to the forefront, especially as they expand across various sectors. In response to these challenges, there is an urgent need for the development of sustainable AI solutions. These solutions must focus on energy-efficient embedded systems that are capable of handling diverse data types even in environments with limited resources, thereby ensuring both technological progress and environmental responsibility. Integrating complementary multimodal data into tiny machine learning models for edge devices is challenging due to increased complexity, latency, and power consumption. This work introduces TinyM$^2$Net-V3, a system that processes different modalities of complementary data, designs deep neural network (DNN) models, and employs model compression techniques including knowledge distillation and low bit-width quantization with memory-aware considerations to fit models within lower memory hierarchy levels, reducing latency and enhancing energy efficiency on resource-constrained devices. We evaluated TinyM$^2$Net-V3 in two multimodal case studies: COVID-19 detection using cough, speech, and breathing audios, and pose classification from depth and thermal images. With tiny inference models (6 KB and 58 KB), we achieved 92.95% and 90.7% accuracies, respectively. Our tiny machine learning models, deployed on resource limited hardware, demonstrated low latencies within milliseconds and very high power efficiency.

Naturally, the optimal control of such a system depends on an accurate prediction of solar thermal production.
  Experimental testing and physics-based numerical models are used to find a collector's performance curve - the mapping from solar radiation and other external conditions to heat production - but this curve changes over time once the collector is exposed to outdoor conditions. In order to deploy advanced control strategies in small domestic installations, we present an approach that uses machine learning to automatically construct and continuously adapt a model that predicts heat production. Our design is driven by the need to (a) construct and adapt models using supervision that can be extracted from low-cost instrumentation, avoiding extreme accuracy and reliability requirements; and (b) at inference time, use inputs that are typically provided in publicly available weather forecasts.
  Recent developments in attention-based machine learning, as well as careful adaptation of the training setup to the specifics of the task, have allowed us to design a machine learning-based solution that covers our requirements. We present positive empirical results for the predictive accuracy of our solution, and discuss the impact of these results on the end-to-end system.

This paper explores the application of novel operator learning methodologies to unravel the intricate dynamics of flame instability, particularly focusing on hybrid instabilities arising from the coexistence of Darrieus-Landau (DL) and Diffusive-Thermal (DT) mechanisms. Training datasets encompass a wide range of parameter configurations, enabling the learning of parametric solution advancement operators using techniques such as parametric Fourier Neural Operator (pFNO), and parametric convolutional neural networks (pCNN). Results demonstrate the efficacy of these methods in accurately predicting short-term and long-term flame evolution across diverse parameter regimes, capturing the characteristic behaviors of pure and blended instabilities. Comparative analyses reveal pFNO as the most accurate model for learning short-term solutions, while all models exhibit robust performance in capturing the nuanced dynamics of flame evolution. This research contributes to the development of robust modeling frameworks for understanding and controlling complex physical processes governed by nonlinear PDE.

However, existing SOD algorithms are mainly designed or trained for one particular type of inputs, failing to be generalized to other types of inputs. Consequentially, more types of SOD algorithms need to be prepared in advance for handling different types of inputs, raising huge hardware and research costs. Differently, in this paper, we propose a new type of SOD task, termed Arbitrary Modality SOD (AM SOD). The most prominent characteristics of AM SOD are that the modality types and modality numbers will be arbitrary or dynamically changed. The former means that the inputs to the AM SOD algorithm may be arbitrary modalities such as RGB, depths, or even any combination of them. While, the latter indicates that the inputs may have arbitrary modality numbers as the input type is changed, e.g. single-modality RGB image, dual-modality RGB-Depth (RGB-D) images or triple-modality RGB-Depth-Thermal (RGB-D-T) images. Accordingly, a preliminary solution to the above challenges, Ä±.e. a modality switch network (MSN), is proposed in this paper. In particular, a modality switch feature extractor (MSFE) is first designed to extract discriminative features from each modality effectively by introducing some modality indicators, which will generate some weights for modality switching. Subsequently, a dynamic fusion module (DFM) is proposed to adaptively fuse features from a variable number of modalities based on a novel Transformer structure. Finally, a new dataset, named AM-XD, is constructed to facilitate research on AM SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AM SOD method can effectively cope with changes in the type and number of input modalities for robust salient object detection.

Various factors during metal printing affect the printed parts' quality, including the power quality, the printing stage parameters, the print part's location inside the print bed, the curing stage parameters, and the metal sintering process. With the large data gathered from HP's MetJet printing process, AI techniques can be used to analyze, learn, and effectively infer the printed part quality metrics, as well as assist in improving the print yield. In-situ thermal sensing data captured by printer-installed thermal sensors contains the part thermal signature of fusing layers. Such part thermal signature contains a convoluted impact from various factors. In this paper, we use a multimodal thermal encoder network to fuse data of a different nature including the video data vectorized printer control data, and exact part thermal signatures with a trained encoder-decoder module.

This advantage stems from the inherent suitability of optical signals to carry out matrix multiplication. However, even deterministic phenomena such as thermal crosstalk make precise programming of photonic chips a challenging task. Here, we train and experimentally evaluate three models incorporating varying degrees of physics intuition to predict the effect of thermal crosstalk in different locations of an integrated programmable photonic mesh. We quantify the effect of thermal crosstalk by the resonance wavelength shift in the power spectrum of a microring resonator implemented in the chip, achieving modelling errors <0.5 pm. We experimentally validate the models through compensation of the crosstalk-induced wavelength shift. Finally, we evaluate the generalization capabilities of one of the models by employing it to predict and compensate for the effect of thermal crosstalk for parts of the chip it was not trained on, revealing root-mean-square-errors of <2.0 pm.

It enables more opportunities to architect 3DICs with different die configurations. It becomes increasingly important to perform thermal analysis in the early design phases to validate the architectural design decisions. This is even more critical for microfluidic cooling equipped 3DICs as the embedded cooling structures greatly influence the performance, power, and reliability of the stacked system. We exploited the existing architectural simulators and developed a Pre-register-transfer-level (Pre-RTL) thermal simulation methodology named Hot-LEGO that integrates these tools with their latest features such as support for microfluidic cooling and 3DIC stacking configurations. This methodology differs from existing ones by looking into the design granularity at a much finer level which enables the exploration of unique architecture combinations across the vertical stack. Though architectural-level simulators are not designed for signoff-calibre, it offers speed and agility which are imperative for early design space exploration. We claim that this ongoing work will speed up the co-design cycle of microfluidic cooling and offer a portable methodology for architects to perform exhaustive search for the optimal microarchitecture solutions in 3DICs.

Extensive experiments have shown that, compared to similar RGB-T trackers, our designed teacher model achieved the highest precision rate, while the student model, with comparable precision rate to the teacher model, realized an inference speed more than three times faster than the teacher model.(Codes will be available if accepted.)

Our initial design harnessed the temperature-responsive, viscoelastic properties of Polycaprolactone (PCL) to modulate stiffness and damping, facilitated by integrated flexible Peltier elements. While effective, the reliance on compressing and the inherent stress relaxation characteristics of PCL led to suboptimal response times in impedance adjustments. Addressing these limitations, the current iteration of our module pivots to a novel 'shear-mode' operation. By conducting comprehensive shear rheology analyses on PCL, we have identified a configuration that eliminates the viscoelastic delay, offering a faster response with improved heat transfer efficiency. A key advantage of our module lies in its scalability and elimination of additional mechanical actuators for impedance adjustment. The compactness and efficiency of thermal actuation through Peltier elements allow for significant downsizing, making these thermal, variable impedance modules exceptionally well-suited for applications where space constraints and actuator weight are critical considerations. This development represents a significant leap forward in the design of variable impedance actuators, offering a more versatile, responsive, and compact solution for a wide range of robotic and biomechanical applications.

Transverse matrix cracking and delamination are modeled with a mixed-mode fatigue cohesive zone model, covering crack initiation and propagation. Furthermore, XFEM is used for simulating transverse matrix cracks and splits at arbitrary locations. An adaptive cycle jump approach is employed for efficiently simulating high-cycle fatigue while accounting for local stress ratio variations in the presence of thermal residual stresses. The cycle jump scheme is integrated in the XFEM framework, where the local stress ratio is used to determine the insertion of cracks and to propagate fatigue damage. The fatigue cohesive zone model is based on S-N curves and requires static material properties and only a few fatigue parameters, calibrated on simple fracture testing specimens. The simulations demonstrate a good correspondence with experiments in terms of fatigue life and damage evolution.

However, serious accuracy problems may emerge when taking time steps that far exceed the explicit stability limits. In our previous work, we compared the accuracy and performance of advancing parabolic operators in a thermodynamic MHD model using an implicit method and an explicit super time-stepping (STS) method. We found that while the STS method outperformed the implicit one with overall good results, it was not able to damp oscillatory behavior in the solution efficiently, hindering its practical use. In this follow-up work, we evaluate an easy-to-implement method for selecting a practical time step limit (PTL) for unconditionally stable schemes. This time step is used to `cycle' the operator-split thermal conduction and viscosity parabolic operators. We test the new time step with both an implicit and STS scheme for accuracy, performance, and scaling. We find that, for our test cases here, the PTL dramatically improves the STS solution, matching or improving the solution of the original implicit scheme, while retaining most of its performance and scaling advantages. The PTL shows promise to allow more accurate use of unconditionally stable schemes for parabolic operators and reliable use of STS methods.

Furthermore, electric buses have lower life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than diesel buses, particularly when operated with sustainably produced electricity. However, the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system can consume a significant amount of energy, thus limiting the achievable driving range. In this paper, we address the HVAC system in an electric city bus by analyzing the trade-off between the energy consumption and the thermal comfort of the passengers. We do this by developing a dynamic thermal model for the bus, which we simplify by considering it to be in steady state. We introduce a method that is able to quickly optimize the steady-state HVAC system inputs for a large number of samples representative of a year-round operation. A comparison between the results from the steady-state optimization approach and a dynamic simulation reveals small deviations in both the HVAC system power demand and achieved thermal comfort. Thus, the approximation of the system performance with a steady-state model is justified. We present two case studies to demonstrate the practical relevance of the approach. First, we show how the method can be used to compare different HVAC system designs based on a year-round performance evaluation. Second, we show how the method can be used to extract setpoints for online controllers that achieve close-to-optimal performance without any predictive information. In conclusion, this study shows that a steady-state analysis of the HVAC systems of an electric city bus is a valuable approach to evaluate and optimize its performance.

When a large number of particles are absorbed in a short time scale, the dynamics tend to a non-linear diffusion-type equation called the Rosseland approximation. The main challenges for constructing numerical schemes that exhibit the correct limiting behavior are posed by the solution's high-dimensional phase space and multi-scale effects. In this work, we propose an asymptotic-preserving and rank-adaptive dynamical low-rank approximation scheme based on the macro-micro decomposition of the particle density and a modified augmented basis-update \& Galerkin integrator. We show that this scheme, for linear particle emission by the material, dissipates energy over time under a step size restriction that captures the hyperbolic and parabolic CFL conditions. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in a series of numerical experiments.

In recent times, in particular, machine learning-based methods are becoming increasingly popular as advanced support tools. When dealing with control problems, reinforcement learning has been applied to decision-making in several applications, most notably in games. The success of these methods in finding solutions to complex problems motivates the exploration of new areas where they can be employed to overcome current difficulties. In this paper, we explore the use of automatic control strategies to initial boundary value problems in thermal and disease transport. Specifically, in this work, we adapt an existing reinforcement learning algorithm using a stochastic policy gradient method and we introduce two novel reward functions to drive the flow of the transported field. The new model-based framework exploits the interactions between a reaction-diffusion model and the modified agent. The results show that certain controls can be implemented successfully in these applications, although model simplifications had to be assumed.

While advanced machine learning models strive for accuracy, their computational demands clash with the limitations of resource-constrained devices, hampering real-time performance. In our current research, we tackle this challenge, by introducing ``YOLO Phantom", one of the smallest YOLO models ever conceived. YOLO Phantom utilizes the novel Phantom Convolution block, achieving comparable accuracy to the latest YOLOv8n model while simultaneously reducing both parameters and model size by 43\%, resulting in a significant 19\% reduction in Giga Floating-Point Operations (GFLOPs). YOLO Phantom leverages transfer learning on our multimodal RGB-infrared dataset to address low-light and occlusion issues, equipping it with robust vision under adverse conditions. Its real-world efficacy is demonstrated on an IoT platform with advanced low-light and RGB cameras, seamlessly connecting to an AWS-based notification endpoint for efficient real-time object detection. Benchmarks reveal a substantial boost of 17\% and 14\% in frames per second (FPS) for thermal and RGB detection, respectively, compared to the baseline YOLOv8n model. For community contribution, both the code and the multimodal dataset are available on GitHub.

However, linked with its benefits are challenges, including sensitivity to lighting conditions and privacy concerns. One possibility to overcome these vulnerabilities is to resort to different modalities. For instance, thermal is particularly adept at accentuating human forms, while depth adds crucial contextual layers. Despite their known benefits, only a few HBA-specific datasets that integrate these modalities exist. To address this shortage, our research introduces a novel generative technique for creating trimodal, i.e., RGB, thermal, and depth, human-focused datasets. This technique capitalizes on human segmentation masks derived from RGB images, combined with thermal and depth backgrounds that are sourced automatically. With these two ingredients, we synthesize depth and thermal counterparts from existing RGB data utilizing conditional image-to-image translation. By employing this approach, we generate trimodal data that can be leveraged to train models for settings with limited data, bad lightning conditions, or privacy-sensitive areas.

Image-based methods, however, tend to focus predominantly on overt visual cues and often overlook subtler mental state changes. Psychophysiological research has demonstrated that HR and skin temperature are effective in detecting ANS activities, thereby revealing these subtle changes. However, traditional HR tools are generally more costly and less portable, while skin temperature analysis usually necessitates extensive manual processing. Advances in remote-PPG and automatic thermal ROI detection algorithms have been developed to address these issues, yet their accuracy in practical applications remains limited. This study aims to bridge this gap by integrating r-PPG with thermal imaging to enhance prediction performance. Ninety participants completed a 20-minute questionnaire to induce cognitive stress, followed by watching a film aimed at eliciting moral elevation. The results demonstrate that the combination of r-PPG and thermal imaging effectively detects emotional shifts. Using r-PPG alone, the prediction accuracy was 77% for cognitive stress and 61% for moral elevation, as determined by SVM. Thermal imaging alone achieved 79% accuracy for cognitive stress and 78% for moral elevation, utilizing a RF algorithm. An early fusion strategy of these modalities significantly improved accuracies, achieving 87% for cognitive stress and 83% for moral elevation using RF. Further analysis, which utilized statistical metrics and explainable machine learning methods including SHAP, highlighted key features and clarified the relationship between cardiac responses and facial temperature variations. Notably, it was observed that cardiovascular features derived from r-PPG models had a more pronounced influence in data fusion, despite thermal imaging's higher predictive accuracy in unimodal analysis.

Nevertheless, the integrated optical components within PNNs are inherently sensitive to external disturbances and thermal interference, which can detrimentally affect computing accuracy and reliability. Current solutions often use complicated control methods, resulting in high hardware complexity impractical for large-scale PNNs. In response, we propose a novel hardware-aware training and pruning approach. The core idea is to train the parameters of a physical neural network towards its noise-robust and energy-efficient region. This innovation enables control-free and energy-efficient photonic computing. Our method is validated across diverse integrated PNN architectures. Through experimental validation, our approach significantly enhances the computing precision of MRR-based PNN, achieving a notable 4-bit improvement without the need for complex device control mechanisms or energy-intensive temperature stabilization circuits. Specifically, it improves the accuracy of experimental handwritten digit classification from 67.0% to 95.0%, nearing theoretical limits and achieved without a thermoelectric controller. Additionally, this approach reduces the energy by tenfold. We further extend the validation to various architectures, such as PCM-based PNN, demonstrating the broad applicability of our approach across different platforms. This advancement represents a significant step towards the practical, energy-efficient, and noise-resilient implementation of large-scale integrated PNNs.

Elevated temperature can lead to temporary closure failure and, in severe cases, the rupture of PIR. To accurately predict the temperature of PIR, this study combines finite element simulation techniques with Support Vector Regression (SVR) optimized by an Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA) approach. The IWOA includes Tent mapping, a convergence factor based on the sigmoid function, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck variation strategy. The IWOA-SVR model is compared with the SSA-SVR and WOA-SVR. The results reveal that the prediction accuracies of the IWOA-SVR model were 90.2% and 81.5% (above 100$^\circ$C) in the 3$^\circ$C temperature deviation range and 96.3% and 93.4% (above 100$^\circ$C) in the 4$^\circ$C temperature deviation range, surpassing the performance of the comparative models. This research demonstrates the method proposed can realize the online monitoring of the temperature of the PIR, which can effectively prevent thermal faults PIR and provide a basis for the opening and closing of the circuit breaker within a short period.

The study is based on measurements of path gain over 280 outdoor-indoor links, at ranges up to 100 m. A simple theoretical path gain model is extended to include building penetration through multiple sides of the building as well as a reflection from another building. The theoretical model accounts for the building orientation relative to the source, resulting in 4.9 dB RMSE relative to data, as compared to 5.7 dB RMSE from a linear fit and 14.7 dB RMSE for the 3GPP recommended model. Only coarse description of the buildings is required: building orientation and exterior wall composition, without any interior details. Coverage range for SNR>-8 dB from an outdoor base to a terminal just inside a high-efficiency building is under 35 m

As the complexity and compactness of a chiplet-based system increase, careful consideration must be given to microbump assignments, interconnect delays, and thermal limitations during the floorplanning stage. This paper introduces RLPlanner, an efficient early-stage floorplanning tool for chiplet-based systems with a novel fast thermal evaluation method. RLPlanner employs advanced reinforcement learning to jointly minimize total wirelength and temperature. To alleviate the time-consuming thermal calculations, RLPlanner incorporates the developed fast thermal evaluation method to expedite the iterations and optimizations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed fast thermal evaluation method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.25 K and delivers over 120x speed-up compared to the open-source thermal solver HotSpot. When integrated with our fast thermal evaluation method, RLPlanner achieves an average improvement of 20.28\% in minimizing the target objective (a combination of wirelength and temperature), within a similar running time, compared to the classic simulated annealing method with HotSpot.

Model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to be an effective control strategy to enable water heater load shifting in home energy management systems. In this work, we analyze how modeling tank stratification in an MPC formulation impacts control performance for stratified electric water heaters under time-of-use (TOU) rates. Specifically, we propose an MPC formulation based on a three-node thermal model that captures tank stratification, and compare it to a one-node formulation that does not capture stratification and a standard thermostatic controller. These strategies are compared through both real-time laboratory testing and simulation-based evaluation for different water use patterns. Laboratory experiments show cost reductions of 12.3-23.2% for the one-node MPC and 31.2-42.5% for the three-node MPC relative to the thermostatic controller. The performance of the one-node MPC is limited by significant plant-model mismatch, while the three-node formulation better approximates real-world dynamics and results in much more effective cost reduction and load shifting. A simple analysis of how each strategy performs under water use forecast errors is also provided.

The governing equations are provided by a subset of the class of symmetric and hyperbolic thermodynamically compatible (SHTC) models. Our numerical method discretizes the equations for the conservation of momentum, total energy, distortion tensor and thermal impulse vector, hence accounting in one single unified mathematical formalism for a wide range of physical phenomena in continuum mechanics. By means of two conservative corrections directly embedded in the definition of the numerical fluxes, the new schemes are proven to satisfy two extra conservation laws, namely an entropy balance law and a geometric equation that links the distortion tensor to the density evolution. As such, the classical mass conservation equation can be discarded. Firstly, the GCL is derived at the continuous level, and subsequently it is satisfied by introducing the new concepts of general potential and generalized Gibbs relation. Once compatibility of the GCL is ensured, thermodynamic compatibility is tackled in the same manner, thus achieving the satisfaction of a local cell entropy inequality. The two corrections are orthogonal, meaning that they can coexist simultaneously without interfering with each other. The compatibility of the new FV schemes holds true at the semi-discrete level, and time integration of the governing PDE is carried out relying on Runge-Kutta schemes. A large suite of test cases demonstrates the structure preserving properties of the schemes at the discrete level as well.

Despite greater access to earth observation data in agriculture, there is a scarcity of curated and labelled datasets, which limits the potential of its use in training ML models for remote sensing (RS) in agriculture. To this end, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset called SICKLE, which constitutes a time-series of multi-resolution imagery from 3 distinct satellites: Landsat-8, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Our dataset constitutes multi-spectral, thermal and microwave sensors during January 2018 - March 2021 period. We construct each temporal sequence by considering the cropping practices followed by farmers primarily engaged in paddy cultivation in the Cauvery Delta region of Tamil Nadu, India; and annotate the corresponding imagery with key cropping parameters at multiple resolutions (i.e. 3m, 10m and 30m). Our dataset comprises 2,370 season-wise samples from 388 unique plots, having an average size of 0.38 acres, for classifying 21 crop types across 4 districts in the Delta, which amounts to approximately 209,000 satellite images. Out of the 2,370 samples, 351 paddy samples from 145 plots are annotated with multiple crop parameters; such as the variety of paddy, its growing season and productivity in terms of per-acre yields. Ours is also one among the first studies that consider the growing season activities pertinent to crop phenology (spans sowing, transplanting and harvesting dates) as parameters of interest.

Initially, the graph-based framework is utilized to generate diverse thermal management system architectures. The dynamics of these system architectures are modeled under various loading conditions, and an open-loop optimal controller is employed to determine each system's optimal performance. These modeled cases constitute the dataset, with the corresponding optimal performance values serving as the labels for the data. In the subsequent step, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is trained on 30% of the labeled data to predict the systems' performance, effectively addressing a regression problem. Utilizing this trained model, we estimate the performance values for the remaining 70% of the data, which serves as the test set. In the third step, the predicted performance values are employed to rank the test data, facilitating prioritized evaluation of the design scenarios. Specifically, a small subset of the test data with the highest estimated ranks undergoes evaluation via the open-loop optimal control solver. This targeted approach concentrates on evaluating higher-ranked designs identified by the GNN, replacing the exhaustive search (enumeration-based) of all design cases. The results demonstrate a significant average reduction of over 92% in the number of system dynamic modeling and optimal control analyses required to identify optimal design scenarios.

To conduct principled risk analysis, numerous Monte Carlo (MC) samples are drawn from the (foretasted) probability distributions of spatio-temporally correlated stochastic grid variables. The corresponding OPF and SCUC solutions, which are needed to quantify the risk, are generated using traditional OPF and SCUC solvers to generate data for training GNN model(s). The GNN model performance is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of predicting quantities of interests (QoIs) derived from the decision variables in OPF and SCUC. Specifically, we focus on thermal power generation and load shedding at system and individual zone level. We also perform reliability and risk quantification based on GNN predictions and compare with that obtained from OPF/SCUC solutions. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and thus can be good surrogate models for OPF and SCUC. The excellent accuracy of GNN-based reliability and risk assessment further suggests that GNN surrogate has the potential to be applied in real-time and hours-ahead risk quantification.

When the involved dynamics are large-scale (e.g., high-dimensional semi-discretizations of partial differential equations), the optimization becomes computationally infeasible. Existing methods in literature lack computational scalability or solve an approximation of the problem (thereby losing guarantees with respect to the original problem). In this paper, we propose a novel method that circumvents these issues. The method is an extension of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) which is widely used in the context of large-scale machine learning problems. The proposed SGD scheme minimizes the $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of a (differentiable) parametrized dynamical system, and we prove that the scheme is guaranteed to preserve stability with high probability under boundedness conditions on the step size. Conditioned on the stability preservation, we also obtain probabilistic convergence guarantees to local minimizers. The method is also applicable to problems involving non-realizable dynamics as it only requires frequency-domain input-output samples. We demonstrate the potential of the approach on two numerical examples: fixed-order observer design for a large-scale thermal model and controller tuning for an infinite-dimensional system.

However, conventional electronic AI-based processors often encounter challenges related to processing speed and thermal dissipation. As an alternative, optical implementations of such processors have been proposed, capitalizing on the intrinsic information-processing capabilities of light. Within the realm of optical neuromorphic engineering, various optical neural networks (ONNs) have been explored. Among these, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have exhibited notable success in emulating the computational principles of the human brain. Nevertheless, the integration of optical SNN processors has presented formidable obstacles, mainly when dealing with the computational demands of large datasets. In response to these challenges, we introduce a pioneering concept: the Free-space Optical deep Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (OSCNN). This novel approach draws inspiration from computational models of the human eye. We have meticulously designed various optical components within the OSCNN to tackle object detection tasks across prominent benchmark datasets, including MNIST, ETH 80, and Caltech. Our results demonstrate promising performance with minimal latency and power consumption compared to their electronic ONN counterparts. Additionally, we conducted several pertinent simulations, such as optical intensity to-latency conversion and synchronization. Of particular significance is the evaluation of the feature extraction layer, employing a Gabor filter bank, which stands to impact the practical deployment of diverse ONN architectures significantly.

We propose a novel framework for simultaneously training the digital twin of an engineering system and an associated control agent. The twin's training combines adjoint-based data assimilation and system identification methods, while the control agent's training merges model-based optimal control with model-free reinforcement learning. The control agent evolves along two independent paths: one driven by model-based optimal control and the other by reinforcement learning. The digital twin serves as a virtual environment for confrontation and indirect interaction, functioning as an "expert demonstrator." The best policy is selected for real-world interaction and cloned to the other path if training stagnates. We call this framework Reinforcement Twinning (RT). The framework is tested on three diverse engineering systems and control tasks: (1) controlling a wind turbine under varying wind speeds, (2) trajectory control of flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs) facing wind gusts, and (3) mitigating thermal loads in managing cryogenic storage tanks. These test cases use simplified models with known ground truth closure laws. Results show that the adjoint-based digital twin training is highly sample-efficient, completing within a few iterations. For the control agent training, both model-based and model-free approaches benefit from their complementary learning experiences. The promising results pave the way for implementing the RT framework on real systems.

Algorithms to predict the thermal state of a building on a certain time horizon with a good confidence are essential for the implementation of effective control systems. This work presents a global Transformer architecture for indoor temperature forecasting in multi-room buildings, aiming at optimizing energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with HVAC systems. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the development of more sophisticated forecasting models compared to traditional feedback control systems. The proposed global Transformer architecture can be trained on the entire dataset encompassing all rooms, eliminating the need for multiple room-specific models, significantly improving predictive performance, and simplifying deployment and maintenance. Notably, this study is the first to apply a Transformer architecture for indoor temperature forecasting in multi-room buildings. The proposed approach provides a novel solution to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of temperature forecasting, serving as a valuable tool to optimize energy consumption and decrease greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector.

We established a self-collected TIR dataset consisting of multiple scenes imitating human rescue situations using a TIR camera (FLIR). Additionally, to address dataset scarcity and improve model robustness, a synthetic dataset from a 3D game (ARMA3) to augment the data is further collected. However, a significant domain gap exists between synthetic TIR and real TIR images. Hence, a proper domain adaptation algorithm is essential to overcome the gap. Therefore, we suggest a domain adaptation algorithm in a target-background separated manner from 3D game-to-real, based on a generative model, to address this issue. Furthermore, a segmentation network with fixed-weight kernels at the head is proposed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and provide weak attention, as remote TIR targets inherently suffer from unclear boundaries. Experiment results reveal that the network trained on augmented data consisting of translated synthetic and real TIR data outperforms that trained on only real TIR data by a large margin. Furthermore, the proposed segmentation model surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

Considering the dynamic nature of the design industry where new challenges are continually emerging, alternative sources of knowledge need to be sought to guide future design efforts. One promising avenue lies in the analysis of design optimization data, which has the potential to offer valuable insights and overcome the limitations of heritage designs. This paper presents a step toward extracting knowledge from optimization data in multi-split fluid-based thermal management systems using different classification machine learning methods, so that designers can use it to guide decisions in future design efforts. This approach offers several advantages over traditional design heritage methods, including applicability in cases where there is no design heritage and the ability to derive optimal designs. We showcase our framework through four case studies with varying levels of complexity. These studies demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing the design of complex thermal management systems. Our results show that the knowledge extracted from the configuration design optimization data provides a good basis for more general design of complex thermal management systems. It is shown that the objective value of the estimated optimal configuration closely approximates the true optimal configuration with less than 1 percent error, achieved using basic features based on the system heat loads without involving the corresponding optimal open loop control (OLOC) features. This eliminates the need to solve the OLOC problem, leading to reduced computation costs.

Novel model formulations for the grid-aware operation of both individual small-scale heat pumps and large-scale power-to-heat (PtH) units located in district heating networks are presented. The functionality of the models and the contribution of flexible heating systems for transmission grid congestion management is evaluated by running simulations for the target year 2035 for the German transmission grid. The findings show a decrease in annual conventional redispatch volumes and renewable energy sources (RES) curtailment resulting in cost savings of approximately 6 % through the integration of flexible heating systems in the grid congestion management scheme. The analysis suggests that especially large-scale PtH units in combination with thermal energy storages can contribute significantly to the alleviation of grid congestion and foster RES integration.

Despite this, as systems get larger and more complex, human practice and insight may not suffice to determine the desired thermal management system designs. To this end, a framework for automatic architecture exploration is presented in this article for a class of single-phase, multi-split cooling systems. For this class of systems, heat generation devices are clustered based on their spatial information, and flow-split are added only when required and at the location of heat devices. To generate different architectures, candidate architectures are represented as graphs. From these graphs, dynamic physics models are created automatically using a graph-based thermal modeling framework. Then, an optimal fluid flow distribution problem is solved by addressing temperature constraints in the presence of exogenous heat loads to achieve optimal performance. The focus in this work is on the design of general multi-split heat management systems. The architectures discussed here can be used for various applications in the domain of configuration design. The multi-split algorithm can produce configurations where splitting can occur at any of the vertices. The results presented include 3 categories of cases and are discussed in detail.

An important factor in selection of the hardware building blocks is the identification of candidate materials with physical properties suitable to emulate the large dynamic ranges and varied timescales of neuronal signaling. Previous work has shown that the all-or-none spiking behavior of neurons can be mimicked by threshold switches utilizing phase transitions. Here we demonstrate that devices based on a prototypical metal-insulator-transition material, vanadium dioxide (VO2), can be dynamically controlled to access a continuum of intermediate resistance states. Furthermore, the timescale of their intrinsic relaxation can be configured to match a range of biologically-relevant timescales from milliseconds to seconds. We exploit these device properties to emulate three aspects of neuronal analog computation: fast (~1 ms) spiking in a neuronal soma compartment, slow (~100 ms) spiking in a dendritic compartment, and ultraslow (~1 s) biochemical signaling involved in temporal credit assignment for a recently discovered biological mechanism of one-shot learning. Simulations show that an artificial neural network using properties of VO2 devices to control an agent navigating a spatial environment can learn an efficient path to a reward in up to 4 fold fewer trials than standard methods. The phase relaxations described in our study may be engineered in a variety of materials, and can be controlled by thermal, electrical, or optical stimuli, suggesting further opportunities to emulate biological learning.

We propose a non-speech audio-based approach for crowd analytics, leveraging a transformer-based model. Our results demonstrate that non-speech audio alone can be used to conduct such analysis with remarkable accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time when non-speech audio signals are proposed for predicting occupancy. As far as we know, there has been no other similar approach of its kind prior to this. To accomplish this, we deployed our sensor-based platform in the waiting room of a large hospital with IRB approval over a period of several months to capture non-speech audio and thermal images for the training and evaluation of our models. The proposed non-speech-based approach outperformed the thermal camera-based model and all other baselines. In addition to demonstrating superior performance without utilizing speech audio, we conduct further analysis using differential privacy techniques to provide additional privacy guarantees. Overall, our work demonstrates the viability of employing non-speech audio data for accurate occupancy estimation, while also ensuring the exclusion of speech-related content and providing robust privacy protections through differential privacy guarantees.

However, the development of multi-modal perception for VT sensors remains a challenge, limited by the mono camera. In this paper, we propose the GelSplitter, a new framework approach the multi-modal VT sensor with synchronized multi-modal cameras and resemble a more human-like tactile receptor. Furthermore, we focus on 3D tactile reconstruction and implement a compact sensor structure that maintains a comparable size to state-of-the-art VT sensors, even with the addition of a prism and a near infrared (NIR) camera. We also design a photometric fusion stereo neural network (PFSNN), which estimates surface normals of objects and reconstructs touch geometry from both infrared and visible images. Our results demonstrate that the accuracy of RGB and NIR fusion is higher than that of RGB images alone. Additionally, our GelSplitter framework allows for a flexible configuration of different camera sensor combinations, such as RGB and thermal imaging.

In this paper, we establish the Trotter product formula in the trace form, which connects the quantum thermal average and the Boltzmann distribution of a continuous loop in a rigorous way. We prove the qualitative convergence of the standard PIR, and obtain the explicit convergence rates of the continuous loop PIR. These results showcase various approaches to approximate the quantum thermal average, which provide theoretical guarantee for the path integral approaches of quantum thermal equilibrium systems, such as the path integral molecular dynamics.

Unfortunately, visual sensors alone do not address the need for robustness across all the possible terrains, weather, and lighting conditions that WiSAR operations can be conducted in. The use of multi-modal sensors, specifically visual-thermal cameras, is critical in enabling WiSAR UAVs to perform in diverse operating conditions. However, due to the unique challenges posed by the wilderness context, existing dataset benchmarks are inadequate for developing vision-based algorithms for autonomous WiSAR UAVs. To this end, we present WiSARD, a dataset with roughly 56,000 labeled visual and thermal images collected from UAV flights in various terrains, seasons, weather, and lighting conditions. To the best of our knowledge, WiSARD is the first large-scale dataset collected with multi-modal sensors for autonomous WiSAR operations. We envision that our dataset will provide researchers with a diverse and challenging benchmark that can test the robustness of their algorithms when applied to real-world (life-saving) applications.

In this paper, PINNs are employed to solve the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations at moderate to high Reynolds numbers for complex geometries. The presented method utilizes very sparsely distributed solution data in the domain. A detailed investigation on the effect of the amount of supplied data and the PDE-based regularizers is presented. Additionally, a hybrid data-PINNs approach is used to generate a surrogate model of a realistic flow-thermal electronics design problem. This surrogate model provides near real-time sampling and was found to outperform standard data-driven neural networks when tested on unseen query points. The findings of the paper show how PINNs can be effective when used in conjunction with sparse data for solving 3D nonlinear PDEs or for surrogate modeling of design spaces governed by them.

A key component in simulating spectra is the pressure-temperature (PT) profile, which describes the thermal structure of the atmosphere. Current AR pipelines commonly use ad hoc fitting functions here that limit the retrieved PT profiles to simple approximations, but still use a relatively large number of parameters. In this work, we introduce a conceptually new, data-driven parameterization scheme for physically consistent PT profiles that does not require explicit assumptions about the functional form of the PT profiles and uses fewer parameters than existing methods. Our approach consists of a latent variable model (based on a neural network) that learns a distribution over functions (PT profiles). Each profile is represented by a low-dimensional vector that can be used to condition a decoder network that maps $P$ to $T$. When training and evaluating our method on two publicly available datasets of self-consistent PT profiles, we find that our method achieves, on average, better fit quality than existing baseline methods, despite using fewer parameters. In an AR based on existing literature, our model (using two parameters) produces a tighter, more accurate posterior for the PT profile than the five-parameter polynomial baseline, while also speeding up the retrieval by more than a factor of three. By providing parametric access to physically consistent PT profiles, and by reducing the number of parameters required to describe a PT profile (thereby reducing computational cost or freeing resources for additional parameters of interest), our method can help improve AR and thus our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres and their habitability.

Recently, with the rise of prompt learning in computer vision, we can better transfer knowledge from visual large models to downstream tasks. Considering the strong complementarity between visible and thermal modalities, we propose a tracking architecture based on mutual prompt learning between the two modalities. We also design a lightweight prompter that incorporates attention mechanisms in two dimensions to transfer information from one modality to the other with lower computational costs, embedding it into each layer of the backbone.

Electric frequency is an important magnitude in highly renewable grids, as it becomes more volatile and therefore the cost related to maintaining it within safe bounds has significantly increased. So far, costs for frequency-containment ancillary services have been socialised in most countries, but it has become relevant to rethink this regulatory arrangement. In this paper, we discuss the issue of cost allocation for these services, highlighting the need to evolve towards a causation-based regulatory framework. We argue that parties responsible for creating the need for ancillary services should bear these costs. However, this would imply an important change in electricity market policy, therefore it is necessary to understand the impact on current and future investments on generation, as well as on electricity tariffs. Here we provide a mostly qualitative analysis of this issue, defining guidelines for practical implementation and further study.

They employ ground-level infrared (IR) camera-based-TSs (GIRTSs) for collecting thermal images to identi-fy the heat loss sources resulting from poor insulation. However, this identifica-tion process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, necessitating extensive data processing. To automate this, an AI-driven approach is necessary. Therefore, this study proposes a deep learning (DL)-based segmentation framework using the Mask Region Proposal Convolutional Neural Network (Mask RCNN) to validate its applicability to these thermal images. The objective of the framework is to au-tomatically identify, and crop heat loss sources caused by weak insulation, while also eliminating obstructive objects present in those images. By doing so, it min-imizes labor-intensive tasks and provides an automated, consistent, and reliable solution. To validate the proposed framework, approximately 2500 thermal imag-es were collected in collaboration with industrial TS partner. Then, 1800 repre-sentative images were carefully selected with the assistance of experts and anno-tated to highlight the target objects (TO) to form the final dataset. Subsequently, a transfer learning strategy was employed to train the dataset, progressively aug-menting the training data volume and fine-tuning the pre-trained baseline Mask RCNN. As a result, the final fine-tuned model achieved a mean average precision (mAP) score of 77.2% for segmenting the TO, demonstrating the significant po-tential of proposed framework in accurately quantifying energy loss in Scottish homes.

Path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) is a prevailing approach for computing quantum thermal averages by approximating the quantum partition function as a classical isomorphism on an augmented space, enabling efficient classical sampling, but the theoretical knowledge of the ergodicity of the sampling is lacking. Parallel to the standard PIMD with $N$ ring polymer beads, we also study the Matsubara mode PIMD, where the ring polymer is replaced by a continuous loop composed of $N$ Matsubara modes. Utilizing the generalized $Î$ calculus, we prove that both the Matsubara mode PIMD and the standard PIMD have uniform-in-$N$ ergodicity, i.e., the convergence rate towards the invariant distribution does not depend on the number of modes or beads $N$.

However, the complexities of part geometries make it challenging for current models to maintain high accuracy across a wide range of geometries. Additionally, many models report a low mean square error (MSE) across the entire domain (part). However, in each time step, most areas of the domain do not experience significant changes in temperature, except for the heat-affected zones near recent depositions. Therefore, the MSE-based fidelity measurement of the models may be overestimated.
  This paper presents a data-driven model that uses Fourier Neural Operator to capture the local temperature evolution during the additive manufacturing process. In addition, the authors propose to evaluate the model using the $R^2$ metric, which provides a relative measure of the model's performance compared to using mean temperature as a prediction. The model was tested on numerical simulations based on the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method for the Direct Energy Deposition process, and the results demonstrate that the model achieves high fidelity as measured by $R^2$ and maintains generalizability to geometries that were not included in the training process.

A hierarchical approach is proposed to control coupled energy nonlinear systems. The high level hybrid optimization defines the unit commitment, with the optimal transition strategy, and best production profiles. The low level dynamic model predictive control (MPC), receiving the set-points from the upper layer, safely governs the systems considering process constraints. To enhance the overall efficiency of the system, a method to optimal start-up the GU is here presented: a linear parameter varying MPC computes the optimal trajectory in closed-loop by iteratively linearising the system along the previous optimal solution. The introduction of an intermediate equilibrium state as additional decision variable permits the reduction of the optimization horizon,while a terminal cost term steers the system to the target set-point. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The displacement of the TCP over time can be inferred from thermal models, which comprise a set of geometrically coupled heat equations. Each of these equations represents the temperature in part of the machine, and they are often formulated on complicated geometries.
  The accuracy of the TCP prediction depends highly on the accuracy of the model parameters, such as heat exchange parameters, and the initial temperature. Thus it is of utmost interest to determine the influence of these parameters on the TCP displacement prediction. In turn, the accuracy of the parameter estimate is essentially determined by the measurement accuracy and the sensor placement.
  Determining the accuracy of a given sensor configuration is a key prerequisite of optimal sensor placement. We develop here a thermal model for a particular machine tool. On top of this model we propose two numerical algorithms to evaluate any given thermal sensor configuration with respect to its accuracy. We compute the posterior variances from the posterior covariance matrix with respect to an uncertain initial temperature field. The full matrix is dense and potentially very large, depending on the model size. Thus, we apply a low-rank method to approximate relevant entries, i.e. the variances on its diagonal. We first present a straightforward way to compute this approximation which requires computation of the model sensitivities with with respect to the initial values. Additionally, we present a low-rank tensor method which exploits the underlying system structure. We compare the efficiency of both algorithms with respect to runtime and memory requirements and discuss their respective advantages with regard to optimal sensor placement problems.

Largely, this is due to the limited availability of labeled data. Existing Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques, while promising to leverage labels from existing well-lit RGB images, fail to consider the characteristics of the source domain itself. We holistically account for this factor by proposing Source Preparation (SP), a method to mitigate source domain biases. Our Almost Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (AUDA) framework, a label-efficient semi-supervised approach for robotic scenarios -- employs Source Preparation (SP), Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and Supervised Alignment (SA) from limited labeled data. We introduce CityIntensified, a novel dataset comprising temporally aligned image pairs captured from a high-sensitivity camera and an intensifier camera for semantic segmentation and object detection in low-light settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in semantic segmentation, with experiments showing that SP enhances UDA across a range of visual domains, with improvements up to 40.64% in mIoU over baseline, while making target models more robust to real-world shifts within the target domain. We show that AUDA is a label-efficient framework for effective DA, significantly improving target domain performance with only tens of labeled samples from the target domain.

Despite these advancements, there has been no systematic and comprehensive evaluation of fusing RGB-D and thermal modalities to date. While autonomous driving using LiDAR, radar, RGB, and other sensors has garnered substantial research interest, along with the fusion of RGB and depth modalities, the integration of thermal cameras and, specifically, the fusion of RGB-D and thermal data, has received comparatively less attention. This might be partly due to the limited number of publicly available datasets for such applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of both, state-of-the-art and traditional methods used in fusing RGB-D and thermal camera data for various applications, such as site inspection, human tracking, fault detection, and others. The reviewed literature has been categorised into technical areas, such as 3D reconstruction, segmentation, object detection, available datasets, and other related topics. Following a brief introduction and an overview of the methodology, the study delves into calibration and registration techniques, then examines thermal visualisation and 3D reconstruction, before discussing the application of classic feature-based techniques as well as modern deep learning approaches. The paper concludes with a discourse on current limitations and potential future research directions. It is hoped that this survey will serve as a valuable reference for researchers looking to familiarise themselves with the latest advancements and contribute to the RGB-DT research field.

The GP projects the heat transfer equation onto a mathematical space whose basis functions are generated from thermal data enabled by the POD learning algorithm. The thermal solution data are collected from FEniCS using the finite element method (FEM) accounting for appropriate parametric variations. The GP incorporates physical principles of heat transfer in the methodology to reach high accuracy and efficiency. The dynamic power map for the CPU in FEM thermal simulation is generated from gem5 and McPACT, together with the SPLASH-2 benchmarks as the simulation workload. It is shown that PODTherm-GP offers an accurate thermal prediction of the CPU with a resolution as fine as the FEM. It is also demonstrated that PODTherm-GP is capable of predicting the dynamic thermal profile of the chip with a good accuracy beyond the training conditions. Additionally, the approach offers a reduction in degrees of freedom by more than 5 orders of magnitude and a speedup of 4 orders, compared to the FEM.

The primary objective is to adaptively leverage the relatively dominant modality in varying conditions to achieve more robust tracking compared to single-modality tracking. An RGB-T tracker based on mixed attention mechanism to achieve complementary fusion of modalities (referred to as MACFT) is proposed in this paper. In the feature extraction stage, we utilize different transformer backbone branches to extract specific and shared information from different modalities. By performing mixed attention operations in the backbone to enable information interaction and self-enhancement between the template and search images, it constructs a robust feature representation that better understands the high-level semantic features of the target. Then, in the feature fusion stage, a modality-adaptive fusion is achieved through a mixed attention-based modality fusion network, which suppresses the low-quality modality noise while enhancing the information of the dominant modality. Evaluation on multiple RGB-T public datasets demonstrates that our proposed tracker outperforms other RGB-T trackers on general evaluation metrics while also being able to adapt to longterm tracking scenarios.

An ideal representation of a quantum state combines a succinct characterization informed by the system's structure and symmetries, along with the ability to predict the physical observables of interest. A number of machine learning approaches have been recently used to construct such classical representations [1-6] which enable predictions of observables [7] and account for physical symmetries [8]. However, the structure of a quantum state gets typically lost unless a specialized ansatz is employed based on prior knowledge of the system [9-12]. Moreover, most such approaches give no information about what states are easier to learn in comparison to others. Here, we propose a new generative energy-based representation of quantum many-body states derived from Gibbs distributions used for modeling the thermal states of classical spin systems. Based on the prior information on a family of quantum states, the energy function can be specified by a small number of parameters using an explicit low-degree polynomial or a generic parametric family such as neural nets, and can naturally include the known symmetries of the system. Our results show that such a representation can be efficiently learned from data using exact algorithms in a form that enables the prediction of expectation values of physical observables. Importantly, the structure of the learned energy function provides a natural explanation for the hardness of learning for a given class of quantum states.

A core challenge is to understand the geometry and topography of the landscape that guides the optimization. In this work, we employ standard Statistical Mechanics methods, namely, phase-space exploration using Langevin dynamics, to study this landscape for an over-parameterized fully connected network performing a classification task on random data. Analyzing the fluctuation statistics, in analogy to thermal dynamics at a constant temperature, we infer a clear geometric description of the low-loss region. We find that it is a low-dimensional manifold whose dimension can be readily obtained from the fluctuations. Furthermore, this dimension is controlled by the number of data points that reside near the classification decision boundary. Importantly, we find that a quadratic approximation of the loss near the minimum is fundamentally inadequate due to the exponential nature of the decision boundary and the flatness of the low-loss region. This causes the dynamics to sample regions with higher curvature at higher temperatures, while producing quadratic-like statistics at any given temperature. We explain this behavior by a simplified loss model which is analytically tractable and reproduces the observed fluctuation statistics.

Modeling is vital during these engineered systems' design and operational phases. However, many challenges exist in developing a modeling framework. What is lacking is an accurate framework that (i) captures sharp jumps in the thermal flux across complex vasculature layouts, (ii) deals with oblique derivatives (involving tangential and normal components), (iii) handles nonlinearity because of radiative heat transfer, (iv) provides a high-speed forecast for real-time monitoring, and (v) facilitates robust inverse modeling. This paper addresses these challenges by availing the power of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We develop a fast, reliable, and accurate Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework for vascular-based thermal regulation -- called CoolPINNs: a PINNs-based modeling framework for active cooling. The proposed mesh-less framework elegantly overcomes all the mentioned challenges. The significance of the reported research is multi-fold. First, the framework is valuable for real-time monitoring of thermal regulatory systems because of rapid forecasting. Second, researchers can address complex thermoregulation designs inasmuch as the approach is mesh-less. Finally, the framework facilitates systematic parameter identification and inverse modeling studies, perhaps the current framework's most significant utility.

These issues make it necessary to consider the uncertainty and frequency-related constraints in the economic dispatch (ED) programs. However, existing ED studies rarely proactively optimize the control parameters of inverter-based resources related to fast regulation (e.g., virtual inertia and droop coefficients) in cooperation with other dispatchable resources to improve the system frequency security and dispatch reliability. This paper first proposes a joint chance-constrained economic dispatch model that jointly optimizes the frequency-related inverter control, the system up/down reserves, and base-point power for the minimal total operational cost. In the proposed model, multiple dispatchable resources including thermal units, dispatchable IBRs and energy storage are considered, and the (virtual) inertias, the regulation reserve allocations and the base-point power are coordinated. To ensure the system reliability, the joint chance-constraint formulation is also adopted. Additionally, since the traditional sample average approximation (SAA) method cost much computational burden, a novel mix-SAA (MSAA) method is proposed to transform the original intractable model into a linear model that can be efficiently solved via commercial solvers. The case studies validated the satisfactory efficacy of the proposed ED model and the efficiency of the MSAA.

At the macroscopic level, transport coefficients relate an external forcing of magnitude $Î·$, with $Î·\ll 1$, acting on the system to an average response expressed through some steady-state flux. In practice, steady-state averages involved in the linear response are computed as time averages over a realization of some stochastic differential equation. Variance reduction techniques are of paramount interest in this context, as the linear response is scaled by a factor of $1/Î·$, leading to large statistical error. One way to limit the increase in the variance is to allow for larger values of $Î·$ by increasing the range of values of the forcing for which the nonlinear part of the response is sufficiently small. In theory, one can add an extra forcing to the physical perturbation of the system, called synthetic forcing, as long as this extra forcing preserves the invariant measure of the reference system. The aim is to find synthetic perturbations allowing to reduce the nonlinear part of the response as much as possible. We present a mathematical framework for quantifying the quality of synthetic forcings, in the context of linear response theory, and discuss various possible choices for them. Our findings are illustrated with numerical results in low-dimensional systems.

The models for this simulation are based on the assumption of a steady-state operation. We show two approaches to obtain the minimum energy requirement for a certain thermal comfort criterion under specific ambient conditions. Due to the computationally efficient approach developed, we can evaluate the model on a large dataset of 7500 scenarios in various ambient conditions to estimate the year-round performance of the system subject to different comfort requirements. Compared to a heating strategy based on positive temperature coefficient (PTC) elements, we can thus show that a heat pump (HP) can reduce the annual mean power consumption by up to 60%. Ceiling-mounted radiant heating elements complementing a PTC heating system can reduce the annual mean power consumption by up to 10%, while they cannot improve the energy efficiency when used in conjunction with a HP. Finally, a broad sensitivity study reveals the fact that improving the HP's heating-mode coefficient of performance (COP) manifests the largest leverage in terms of mean annual power consumption. Moreover, the annual energy expenditure for cooling are around eight times smaller than those for heating. The case study considered thus reveals that the advantages of improving the COP of the cooling mode are significantly lower.

The complex low-level interactions between the thermal and the electrical part represent a non-trivial and challenging system to be controlled online. We present a novel controller architecture composed of a supervisory controller for the energy management, a feedforward cylinder deactivation controller, and a track region-dependent low-level nonlinear model predictive controller to optimize the engine actuators. Except for the nonlinear model predictive controller, the proposed controller subsystems are computationally inexpensive and are real time capable. The framework is tested and validated in a simulation environment for several realistic scenarios disturbed by driver actions or grip conditions on the track. In particular, we analyze how the control architecture deals with an unexpected gearshift trajectory during an acceleration phase. Further, we demonstrate how an increased maximum velocity trajectory impacts the online low-level controller. Our results show a suboptimality over an entire lap with respect to the benchmark solution of 49 ms and 64 ms, respectively, which we deem acceptable. Compared to the same control architecture with full knowledge of the disturbances, the suboptimality amounted to only 2 ms and 17 ms. For all case studies we show that the cylinder deactivation capability decreases the suboptimality by 7 to 8 ms.

Utilizing the stochasticity in few-domain ferroelectric material(FE), we propose for the first time, the p-bits based on ferroelectric FET. The stochasticity of the FE p-bits stems from the thermal noise-induced lattice vibration, which renders dipole fluctuations and is tunable by an external electric field. The impact of several key FE parameters on p-bits' stochasticity is evaluated, where the domain properties are revealed to play crucial roles. Furthermore, the integer factorization based on FE p-bits circuit network is performed to verify its functionality, and the accuracy is found to depend on FE p-bits' stochasticity. The proposed FE p-bits possess the advantages of both extremely low hardware coast and the compatibility with CMOS-technology, rendering it a promising candidate for stochastic computing applications.

MQTT communication protocol is utilized to interface the models in RT. Two main studies are carried. In the first, it is found that DERs with frequency-watt droop response can help maintaining stability in the future NYS grid in which thermal synchronous generators have been substituted by renewable energy resources. In the second, results demonstrate that BTM DERs can provide similar level of frequency regulation services expected from large utility-scale generation.

Under some usual assumptions of scattering kernels, the solvability is obtained by showing the positive definiteness of the symmetric coefficient matrix in the boundary conditions. For gas flows with the Cercignani-Lampis gas-surface interaction and inverse-power-law intermolecular potentials, the model can capture the slip and jump coefficients accurately with elegant analytic expressions. On the one hand, the proposed method can apply to the cases of arbitrary order moments with increasing accuracy. On the other hand, the explicit formulae for low-order situations are simpler and more accurate than some existing results in references. Therefore, one may apply these formulae in slip and jump conditions to improve the accuracy of macroscopic fluid dynamic models for gas flows.

Its emergence provides a new solution to the problems of energy utilization and environmental pollution. To coordinate the integrated demand response and uncertainty of renewable energy generation (RGs), a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is constructed. A comprehensive norm consisting of the 1-norm and infinity-norm is used as the uncertainty probability distribution information set, thereby avoiding complex probability density information. To address multiple uncertainties of RGs, a generative adversarial network based on the Wasserstein distance with gradient penalty is proposed to generate RG scenarios, which has wide applicability. To further tap the potential of the demand response, we take into account the ambiguity of human thermal comfort and the thermal inertia of buildings. Thus, an integrated demand response mechanism is developed that effectively promotes the consumption of renewable energy. The proposed method is simulated in an actual CIES in North China. In comparison with traditional stochastic programming and robust optimization, it is verified that the proposed DRO model properly balances the relationship between economical operation and robustness while exhibiting stronger adaptability. Furthermore, our approach outperforms other commonly used DRO methods with better operational economy, lower renewable power curtailment rate, and higher computational efficiency.

Compared to existing work, our approach increases flexibility by operating the thermal network with variable flow temperatures and in that way explicitly exploits its inherent storage capacities. To this end, the microgrid is represented by a multi-layer network composed of an electrical and a thermal layer. We show that the system behavior can be represented by a discrete-time state model derived from DC power flow approximations and 1d incompressible Euler equations. Both layers are interconnected via heat pumps. By combining this model with desired operating objectives and constraints, we obtain a constrained convex optimization problem. This is used to derive a model predictive control scheme for the optimal operation of electro-thermal microgrids. The performance of the proposed operation control algorithm is demonstrated in a numerical case study.

This study investigates the possibility of learning and utilising a system's Hamiltonian and its variational thermal state estimation for data analysis techniques. For this purpose, we employ the method of Quantum Hamiltonian-based models for the generative modelling of simulated Large Hadron Collider data and demonstrate the representability of such data as a mixed state. In a further step, we use the learned Hamiltonian for anomaly detection, showing that different sample types can form distinct dynamical behaviours once treated as a quantum many-body system. We exploit these characteristics to quantify the difference between sample types. Our findings show that the methodologies designed for field theory computations can be utilised in machine learning applications to employ theoretical approaches in data analysis techniques.

A swarm is a cooperative group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that fly together to search and quench the fire effectively. The multi-swarm cooperative information-driven search uses a multi-level search comprising cooperative information-driven exploration and exploitation for quick/accurate detection of fire location. The search level is selected based on the thermal sensor information about the potential fire area. The dynamicity of swarms, aided by global regulative repulsion and merging between swarms, reduces the detection and mitigation time compared to the existing methods. The local attraction among the members of the swarm helps the non-detector members to reach the fire location faster, and divide-and-conquer mitigation control ensures a non-overlapping fire sector allocation for all members quenching the fire. The performance of MSCIDC has been compared with different multi-UAV methods using a simulated environment of pine forest. The performance clearly shows that MSCIDC mitigates fire much faster than the multi-UAV methods. The Monte-Carlo simulation results indicate that the proposed method reduces the average forest area burnt by $65\%$ and mission time by $60\%$ compared to the best result case of the multi-UAV approaches, guaranteeing a faster and successful mission.

In this work, we propose the first algorithm to achieve the Heisenberg limit for learning an interacting $N$-qubit local Hamiltonian. After a total evolution time of $\mathcal{O}(Îµ^{-1})$, the proposed algorithm can efficiently estimate any parameter in the $N$-qubit Hamiltonian to $Îµ$-error with high probability. The proposed algorithm is robust against state preparation and measurement error, does not require eigenstates or thermal states, and only uses $\mathrm{polylog}(Îµ^{-1})$ experiments. In contrast, the best previous algorithms, such as recent works using gradient-based optimization or polynomial interpolation, require a total evolution time of $\mathcal{O}(Îµ^{-2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(Îµ^{-2})$ experiments. Our algorithm uses ideas from quantum simulation to decouple the unknown $N$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ into noninteracting patches, and learns $H$ using a quantum-enhanced divide-and-conquer approach. We prove a matching lower bound to establish the asymptotic optimality of our algorithm.

They have applications in soft robotics, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics. By linking the structure to the properties of these materials, it is possible to perform material design rationally. Liquid-metal embedded elastomers (LMEEs) have been designed for targeted electro-thermo-mechanical properties by semi-supervised learning of structure-property (SP) links in a variational autoencoder network (VAE). The design parameters are the microstructural descriptors that are physically meaningful and have affine relationships with the synthetization of the studied particulate composite. The machine learning (ML) model is trained on a generated dataset of microstructural descriptors with their multifunctional property quantities as their labels. Sobol sequence is used for in-silico Design of Experiment (DoE) by sampling the design space to generate a comprehensive dataset of 3D microstructure realizations via a packing algorithm. The mechanical responses of the generated microstructures are simulated using a previously developed Finite Element (FE) model, considering the surface tension induced by LM inclusions, while the linear thermal and dielectric constants are homogenized with the help of our in-house Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) package. Following the training by minimization of an appropriate loss function, the VAE encoder acts as the surrogate of numerical solvers of the multifunctional homogenizations, and its decoder is used for the material design. Our results indicate the satisfactory performance of the surrogate model and the inverse calculator with respect to high-fidelity numerical simulations validated with LMEE experimental results.

In particular, coherent IPNNs use arrays of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) for unitary transformations to perform energy-efficient matrix-vector multiplication. However, the underlying MZI devices in IPNNs are susceptible to uncertainties stemming from optical lithographic variations and thermal crosstalk and can experience imprecisions due to non-uniform MZI insertion loss and quantization errors due to low-precision encoding in the tuned phase angles. In this paper, we, for the first time, systematically characterize the impact of such uncertainties and imprecisions (together referred to as imperfections) in IPNNs using a bottom-up approach. We show that their impact on IPNN accuracy can vary widely based on the tuned parameters (e.g., phase angles) of the affected components, their physical location, and the nature and distribution of the imperfections. To improve reliability measures, we identify critical IPNN building blocks that, under imperfections, can lead to catastrophic degradation in the classification accuracy. We show that under multiple simultaneous imperfections, the IPNN inferencing accuracy can degrade by up to 46%, even when the imperfection parameters are restricted within a small range. Our results also indicate that the inferencing accuracy is sensitive to imperfections affecting the MZIs in the linear layers next to the input layer of the IPNN.

The method gains efficiency by exploiting the potential sparsity of the intermediate solutions. We implemented the method to call quadprog of MATLAB iteratively. In comparison with a single call of quadprog, we obtain a 10-fold speedup on two proximity graph problems in $\mathbb{R}^d$ on some public data sets, a 10-fold speedup on the minimum enclosing ball problem on random points in a unit cube in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and a 5-fold speedup on the polytope distance problem on random points from a cube in $\mathbb{R}^d$ when the input size is significantly larger than the dimension; we also obtain a 2-fold or more speedup on deblurring some gray-scale space and thermal images via non-negative least square. We compare with two minimum enclosing ball software by GÃ¤rtner and Fischer et al.; for 1000 nearly cospherical points or random points in a unit cube, the iterative method overtakes the software by GÃ¤rtner at 20 dimensions and the software by Fischer et al. at 170 dimensions. In the image deblurring experiments, the iterative method compares favorably with other software that can solve non-negative least square, including FISTA with backtracking, SBB, FNNLS, and lsqnonneg of MATLAB. We analyze theoretically the number of iterations taken by the iterative scheme to reduce the gap between the current solution value and the optimum by a factor $e$. Under certain assumptions, we prove a bound proportional to the square root of the number of variables.

The use of an integrate-and-dump detector makes precise waveform shaping unnecessary, thereby equipping the scheme with a high degree of robustness to nonlinear signal distortions introduced by practical modulators. Signal sequences drawn from star quadrature amplitude modulation (SQAM) formats admit an efficient trellis description that facilitates codebook design and low-complexity near maximum-likelihood sequence detection in the presence of both shot noise and thermal noise. Under the practical (though suboptimal) allocation of a 50% duty cycle between ISI-free and ISI-present signalling segments, at a symbol rate of 50 Gbaud and a launch power of -10 dBm the Tukey scheme has a maximum theoretically achievable throughput of 200 Gb/s with an (8,4)-SQAM constellation, while an IMDD scheme achieves about 145 Gb/s using PAM-8. Note that the two mentioned constellations have the same number of magnitude levels and the difference in throughput is resulting from exploiting phase information under using a complex-valued signal constellation.

The nudged elastic band (NEB) method is one of the most commonly used schemes to compute MEPs numerically. It approximates an MEP by a discrete set of configuration images, where the discretization size determines both computational cost and accuracy of the simulations. In this paper, we consider a discrete MEP to be a stationary state of the NEB method and prove an optimal convergence rate of the discrete MEP with respect to the number of images. Numerical simulations for the transitions of some several proto-typical model systems are performed to support the theory.

It is based on large vectors of binary or bipolar symbols and a few simple mathematical operations. The promise of HDC is a highly efficient implementation for embedded systems like wearables. While fast implementations have been presented, other constraints have not been considered for edge computing. In this work, we aim at answering how thermal-friendly HDC for edge computing is. Devices like smartwatches, smart glasses, or even mobile systems have a restrictive cooling budget due to their limited volume. Although HDC operations are simple, the vectors are large, resulting in a high number of CPU operations and thus a heavy load on the entire system potentially causing temperature violations. In this work, the impact of HDC on the chip's temperature is investigated for the first time. We measure the temperature and power consumption of a commercial embedded system and compare HDC with conventional CNN. We reveal that HDC causes up to 6.8Â°C higher temperatures and leads to up to 47% more CPU throttling. Even when both HDC and CNN aim for the same throughput (i.e., perform a similar number of classifications per second), HDC still causes higher on-chip temperatures due to the larger power consumption.

In this context, this paper presents a novel distributed control strategy to coordinate space heating across numerous residential households with diversified thermal parameters. By employing an iterative algorithm under the game-theoretical framework, each household adjusts its own heating schedule through demand shift and thermal comfort compensation with the purpose of achieving individual cost savings, whereas the aggregate peak demand is effectively shaved on the system level. Additionally, an innovative thermal comfort model which considers both the temporal and spatial differences in customised thermal comfort requirements is proposed. Through a series of case studies, it is demonstrated that the proposed space heating coordination strategy can facilitate effective energy arbitrage for individual buildings, driving a 13.96% reduction in system operational cost and 28.22% peak shaving. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed approach in thermal comfort maintenance is numerically analysed based on the proposed thermal comfort quantification model.

The methods for measuring human stress responses could include subjective questionnaires (developed by psychologists) and objective markers observed using data from wearable and non-wearable sensors. In particular, wearable sensor-based methods commonly use data from electroencephalography, electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, electromyography, electrodermal activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, and photoplethysmography both individually and in multimodal fusion strategies. Whereas, methods based on non-wearable sensors include strategies such as analyzing pupil dilation and speech, smartphone data, eye movement, body posture, and thermal imaging. Whenever a stressful situation is encountered by an individual, physiological, physical, or behavioral change is induced which help in coping with the challenge at hand. A wide range of studies has attempted to establish a relationship between these stressful situations and the response of human beings by using different kinds of psychological, physiological, physical, and behavioral measures. Inspired by the lack of availability of a definitive verdict about the relationship of human stress with these different kinds of markers, a detailed survey about human stress detection methods is conducted in this paper. In particular, we explore how stress detection methods can benefit from artificial intelligence utilizing relevant data from various sources. This review will prove to be a reference document that would provide guidelines for future research enabling effective detection of human stress conditions.

The VEF discretizations are combined with a high-order Discontinuous Galerkin transport discretization to form an effective high-order, linear transport method. The VEF discretizations are derived by extending the unified analysis of Discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic problems to the VEF equations. This framework is used to define analogs of the interior penalty, second method of Bassi and Rebay, minimal dissipation local Discontinuous Galerkin, and continuous finite element methods. The analysis of subspace correction preconditioners, which use a continuous operator to iteratively precondition the discontinuous discretization, is extended to the case of the non-symmetric VEF system. Numerical results demonstrate that the VEF discretizations have arbitrary-order accuracy on curved meshes, preserve the thick diffusion limit, and are effective on a proxy problem from thermal radiative transfer in both outer transport iterations and inner preconditioned linear solver iterations. In addition, a parallel weak scaling study of the interior penalty VEF discretization demonstrates the scalability of the method out to 1152 processors.

The focus here is the class of physically symmetric and positive definite tensors, as they appear often in the description of materials, and one wants to be able to prescribe certain classes of spatial symmetries and invariances for each member of the whole ensemble, while at the same time demanding that the mean or expected value of the ensemble be subject to a possibly 'higher' spatial invariance class. We formulate a modelling framework which not only respects these two requirements$-$positive definiteness and invariance$-$but also allows a fine control over orientation on one hand, and strength/size on the other. As the set of positive definite tensors is not a linear space, but rather an open convex cone in the linear space of physically symmetric tensors, we consider it advantageous to widen the notion of mean to the so-called FrÃ©chet mean on a metric space, which is based on distance measures or metrics between positive definite tensors other than the usual Euclidean one. It is shown how the random ensemble can be modelled and generated, independently in its scaling and orientational or directional aspects, with a Lie algebra representation via a memoryless transformation. The parameters which describe the elements in this Lie algebra are then to be considered as random fields on the domain of interest. As an example, a 2D and a 3D model of steady-state heat conduction in a human proximal femur, a bone with high material anisotropy, is modelled with a random thermal conductivity tensor, and the numerical results show the distinct impact of incorporating into the constitutive model different material uncertainties$-$scaling, orientation, and prescribed material symmetry$-$on the desired quantities of interest.

Centralized storage can help but is costly. An alternative is to shift demand. Cooling and heating demands are substantial and can be economically shifted using thermal storage. To estimate what thermal storage, employed at scale, might do to reshape electricity loads, we pair fine-scale weather data with hourly electricity use to estimate the share of temperature-sensitive demand across 31 regions that span the continental United States. We then show how much variability can be reduced by shifting temperature-sensitive loads, with and without improved transmission between regions. We find that approximately three quarters of within-day, within-region demand variability can be eliminated by shifting just half of temperature-sensitive demand. The variability-reducing benefits of shifting temperature-sensitive demand complement those gained from improved interregional transmission, and greatly mitigate the challenge of serving higher peaks under climate change.

It leverages the performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) units in modelling sequences of data for the processing of features extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. Three distinct training strategies, which follow a coarse-to-fine funnelled approach, are combined to facilitate feature learning and improve end-to-end pose estimation by regression. The capability of CNNs to autonomously ascertain feature representations from images is exploited to fuse thermal infrared data with red-green-blue (RGB) inputs, thus mitigating the effects of artefacts from imaging space objects in the visible wavelength. Each contribution of the proposed framework, dubbed ChiNet, is demonstrated on a synthetic dataset, and the complete pipeline is validated on experimental data.

These thermistors are sensitive to temperature changes near their location on-device. While they are designed to measure the temperature of the device components such as the battery, they can also sense changes in the temperature of the ambient environment or thermal entities in contact with the device. We have developed a model to estimate core body temperature from signals sensed by these thermistors during a user interaction in which the user places the capacitive touchscreen of a smart device against a thermal site on their body such as their forehead. During the interaction, the device logs the temperature sensed by the thermistors as well as the raw capacitance seen by the touch screen to capture features describing the rate of heat transfer from the body to the device and device-to-skin contact respectively. These temperature and contact features are then used to model the rate of heat transferred from the user's body to the device and thus core-body temperature of the user for ubiquitous and accessible fever monitoring using only a smart device. We validate this system in a lab environment on a simulated skin-like heat source with a temperature estimate mean absolute error of 0.743$^{\circ}$F (roughly 0.4$^{\circ}$C) and limit of agreement of $\pm2.374^{\circ}$F (roughly 1.3$^{\circ}$C) which is comparable to some off-the-shelf peripheral and tympanic thermometers. We found a Pearson's correlation $R^2$ of 0.837 between ground truth temperature and temperature estimated by our system. We also deploy this system in an ongoing clinical study on a population of 7 participants in a clinical environment to show the similarity between simulated and clinical trials.

The design variables are physical descriptors of the material microstructure that directly link microstructure to the material's properties. A sufficiently large and uniformly sampled database was generated based on the Sobol sequence. Microstructures were realized using an efficient dense packing algorithm, and the TCs were obtained using our previously developed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) homogenization method. Our optimized ML method is trained over the generated database and establishes the complex relationship between the structure and properties. Finally, the application of the trained ML model in the inverse design of a new class of composite materials, liquid metal (LM) elastomer, with desired TC is discussed. The results show that the surrogate model is accurate in predicting the microstructure behavior with respect to high-fidelity FFT simulations, and inverse design is robust in finding microstructure parameters according to case studies.

The performance of BSNs depend on two important parameters: the correlation time associated with the random magnetization dynamics in a LBM, and the spin-polarized pinning current which stabilizes the magnetization of a LBM in a chosen direction within a chosen time. Here, we show that common fabrication defects in LBMs make these two parameters unpredictable since they are strongly sensitive to the defects. That makes the design of BSNs with real LBMs very challenging. Unless the LBMs are fabricated with extremely tight control, the BSNs which use them could be unreliable or suffer from poor yield.

We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited data.

Experiments on a character-level language model demonstrate that CAFL-L achieves superior constraint satisfaction compared to standard FedAvg (reducing memory usage by 20% and communication by 95%) while maintaining competitive validation performance, making it practical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Traditional thermal error correction/compensation methods rely on measured temperature-deformation fields or on transfer functions. Most existing data-driven compensation strategies employ neural networks (NNs) to directly predict thermal errors or specific compensation values. While effective, these approaches are tightly bound to particular error types, spatial locations, or machine configurations, limiting their generality and adaptability. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm in which NNs are trained to predict high-fidelity temperature and heat flux fields within the machine tool. The proposed framework enables subsequent computation and correction of a wide range of error types using modular, swappable downstream components. The NN is trained using data obtained with the finite element method under varying initial conditions and incorporates a correlation-based selection strategy that identifies the most informative measurement points, minimising hardware requirements during inference. We further benchmark state-of-the-art time-series NN architectures, namely Recurrent NN, Gated Recurrent Unit, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Transformer, and Temporal Convolutional Network, by training both specialised models, tailored for specific initial conditions, and general models, capable of extrapolating to unseen scenarios. The results show accurate and low-cost prediction of temperature and heat flux fields, laying the basis for enabling flexible and generalisable thermal error correction in machine tool environments.

The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961. The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device implementation.

However, electrosurgery adds a risk of thermal injury to surrounding tissue. Expert surgeons estimate desirable cutting velocities based on experience but have no quantifiable reference to indicate if a particular velocity is optimal. Furthermore, prior demonstrations of autonomous electrosurgery have primarily used constant tool velocity, which is not robust to changes in electrosurgical tissue characteristics, power settings, or tool type. Thermal imaging feedback provides information that can be used to reduce thermal injury while balancing cutting force by controlling tool velocity. We introduce Thermography for Electrosurgical Rate Modulation via Optimization (ThERMO) to autonomously reduce thermal injury while balancing cutting force by intelligently controlling tool velocity. We demonstrate ThERMO in tissue phantoms and compare its performance to the constant velocity approach. Overall, ThERMO improves cut success rate by a factor of three and can reduce peak cutting force by a factor of two. ThERMO responds to varying environmental disturbances, reduces damage to tissue, and completes cutting tasks that would otherwise result in catastrophic failure for the constant velocity approach.

We show that the optimal scheduling policy depends on the plant's internal renewable generation and follows a simple threshold structure. Under the optimal policy, thermal based water output decreases monotonically with renewable output, while membrane based water output increases monotonically. We characterize the structure and intuition behind the threshold policy and examine key special properties.

This study proposes an advanced thermal fall detection method using a Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (BiConvLSTM) model, enhanced with spatial, temporal, feature, self, and general attention mechanisms. Through systematic experimentation across hundreds of model variations exploring the integration of attention mechanisms, recurrent modules, and motion flow, we identified top-performing architectures.

These results highlight the generalizability and practicality of the proposed model, setting new standards for thermal fall detection and paving the way toward deployable, high-performance solutions.

Separating these components is essential for understanding object properties such as emissivity, temperature, reflectance and shape. Previous thermography studies often assume that only one component is dominant (e.g., in welding) or that the second component is constant and can be subtracted. However, in near-ambient conditions, which are most relevant to computer vision applications, both components are typically comparable in magnitude and vary over time. We introduce the first method that separates reflected and emitted components of light in videos captured by two thermal cameras with different spectral sensitivities. We derive a dual-band thermal image formation model and develop algorithms to estimate the surface's emissivity and its time-varying temperature while isolating a dynamic background. We quantitatively evaluate our approach using carefully calibrated emissivities for a range of materials and show qualitative results on complex everyday scenes, such as a glass filled with hot liquid and people moving in the background.

Recent methods rely on synthetic data or sparse annotations for limited indoor and even fewer outdoor scenes. We introduce a novel training-free approach for intrinsic image decomposition using only a pair of visible and thermal images. We leverage the principle that light not reflected from an opaque surface is absorbed and detected as heat by a thermal camera. This allows us to relate the ordinalities between visible and thermal image intensities to the ordinalities of shading and reflectance, which can densely self-supervise an optimizing neural network to recover shading and reflectance. We perform quantitative evaluations with known reflectance and shading under natural and artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments across diverse outdoor scenes. The results demonstrate superior performance over recent learning-based models and point toward a scalable path to curating real-world ordinal supervision, previously infeasible via manual labeling.

This work presents a novel framework for resource-efficient and scalable development of accurate, robust, and adaptive internal temperature estimation algorithms by blending physics-based modeling with machine learning, in order to address the key challenges in data collection, model parameterization, and estimator design that traditionally hinder both approaches. In this framework, a physics-based model is leveraged to generate simulation data that includes different operating scenarios by sweeping the model parameters and input profiles. Such a cheap simulation dataset can be used to pre-train the machine learning algorithm to capture the underlying mapping relationship. To bridge the simulation-to-reality gap resulting from imperfect modeling, transfer learning with unsupervised domain adaptation is applied to fine-tune the pre-trained machine learning model, by using limited operational data (without internal temperature values) from target batteries. The proposed framework is validated under different operating conditions and across multiple cylindrical batteries with convective air cooling, achieving a root mean square error of 0.5 °C when relying solely on prior knowledge of battery thermal properties, and less than 0.1 °C when using thermal parameters close to the ground truth. Furthermore, the role of the simulation data quality in the proposed framework has been comprehensively investigated to identify promising ways of synthetic data generation to guarantee the performance of the machine learning model.

Within the framework of the representative volume element (RVE) method, we establish the invariance conditions for the effective tensor and its fluctuation under different symmetry groups of the microstructure. Interestingly, the symmetry of the considered cell type in the RVE method may break the ensemble symmetry and compromise the approximation of the effective properties. To rectify this issue, we introduce dedicated techniques which permit to enforce the expected symmetries in postprocessing and study the implications on the bounds for the effective properties as well as the total, the random and the systematic errors. We provide theoretical arguments that suitable projections lead to unbiased variance-reduction strategies which furthermore enforce the expected symmetries exactly. Through large-scale FFT-based homogenization simulations, we study the symmetry structure of the estimated effective conductivities and their fluctuations. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of the symmetry-projection techniques for fiber-reinforced composite microstructures of industrial scale.

The training dataset was constructed through an automated framework that integrated geometry generation, meshing, and flow-field solutions in ANSYS Fluent. The pin-fin geometry was parameterized using piecewise cubic splines, producing 1,000 diverse configurations through Latin Hypercube Sampling. Each simulation was converted into a graph structure, where nodes carried a feature vector containing spatial coordinates, a normalized streamwise position, one-hot boundary indicators, and a signed distance to the nearest boundary such as wall. This graph structure served as input to the newly developed Graph Neural Network, which was trained to predict temperature, velocity magnitude, and pressure at each node using data from ANSYS. The network predicted fields with outstanding accuracy, capturing boundary layers, recirculation, and the stagnation region upstream of the pin-fins while reducing wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. In conclusion, the novel graph neural network offered a fast and reliable surrogate for simulations in complex flow configurations.

Focusing on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous -- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum model to generate a given classical stochastic process.

The method, in the offline phase, prepares a library of hyperreduced archetype components of various fidelity levels and, in the online phase, assembles the target system using instantiated components whose fidelity is adaptively selected to satisfy a user-prescribed system-level error tolerance. To achieve this, we introduce a hierarchical error estimation framework that compares solutions at successive fidelity levels and drives a local refinement strategy based on component-wise error indicators. We also provide an efficient estimator for the system-level error to ensure that the adaptive strategy meets the desired accuracy. Component-wise hyperreduction is performed using an empirical quadrature procedure, with the training accuracy guided by the Brezzi--Rappaz--Raviart theorem. The proposed method is demonstrated on a family of nonlinear thermal fin systems comprising up to 225 components and 68 parameters. Numerical results show that the hyperreduced basis element model achieves O(100) computational reduction at 1% error level relative to the truth finite-element model. In addition, the adaptive refinement strategy provides more effective error control than uniform refinement by selectively enriching components with higher local errors.

Traditionally TSVs have been considered to improve the thermal conductivity in the vertical direction. However, the lateral thermal blockage effect becomes increasingly important for TSV via farms (a cluster of TSV vias used for signal bus connections between layers) because the TSV size and pitch continue to scale in Î¼m range and the metal to insulator ratio becomes smaller. Consequently, dense TSV farms can create lateral thermal blockages in thinned silicon substrate and exacerbate the local hotspots. In this paper, we propose a thermal-aware via farm placement technique for 3-D ICs to minimize lateral heat blockages caused by dense signal bus TSV structures.

Using six years of hourly data collected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, thermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both individual energy outputs and total production (including imports, which closely follow energy demand, modulo losses) through a Multi-Input Multi-Output ($\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and seasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are incorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\mathtt{ELM}$ model significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for solar and thermal energy, achieving an $\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\%$ and $5.1\%$, respectively, with $\mathtt{R^2} > 0.98$ (1-hour horizon). The model maintains high accuracy up to five hours ahead, beyond which renewable energy sources become increasingly volatile. While $\mathtt{MIMO}$ provides marginal gains over Single-Input Single-Output ($\mathtt{SISO}$) architectures and offers key advantages over deep learning methods such as $\mathtt{LSTM}$, it provides a closed-form solution with lower computational demands, making it well-suited for real-time applications, including online learning. Beyond predictive accuracy, the proposed methodology is adaptable to various contexts and datasets, as it can be tuned to local constraints such as resource availability, grid characteristics, and market structures.

First, 1312 synthetic three-dimensional microstructures were generated and evaluated using established algorithms, and a labeled data set of ground-truth parameters was built. Converting every structure into a persistence image allowed us to train a deep neural network that predicts the eight descriptors. In an independent test set, the model achieved on average R^2 ~ 0.84 and Pearson r ~ 0.92, demonstrating both precision and generality. The approach provides a unified and scalable tool for rapid characterization of functional porous materials.

Here, we introduce a data-driven framework based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs. Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a high transformation temperature of 404 $^\circ$C, a large mechanical work output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal hysteresis of 29 Â°C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields. This study demonstrates that GAN inversion offers an efficient and generalizable route for the property-targeted discovery of complex alloys.

However, our experiments also show the 3D-stacked architecture faces severer thermal issues compared to 2D architecture, in terms of thermal temperature, gradient and scalability. To better exploit the potential of 3D-stacked architecture, we present Tasa, a heterogeneous architecture with cross-stack thermal optimizations to balance the temperature distribution and maximize the performance under the thermal constraints. High-performance core is designed for compute-intensive operations, while high-efficiency core is used for memory-intensive operators, e.g. attention layers. Furthermore, we propose a bandwidth sharing scheduling to improve the bandwidth utilization in such heterogeneous architecture. Extensive thermal experiments show that our Tasa architecture demonstrates greater scalability compared with the homogeneous 3D-stacked architecture, i.e. up to 5.55 $\tccentigrade$, 9.37 $\tccentigrade$, and 7.91 $\tccentigrade$ peak temperature reduction for 48, 60, and 72 core configurations.

To address this gap, we present a novel hybrid physics-machine learning framework that integrates differentiable physical simulations with neural networks. By leveraging automatic differentiation throughout the simulation pipeline, our method enables gradient-based joint optimization of physical parameters and neural network components representing experimental variables, offering superior scalability compared to traditional second-order methods. We demonstrate this framework through application to three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D-ED) structure refinement, where our approach learns complex thickness distributions directly from diffraction data rather than relying on simplified geometric models. This method achieves state-of-the-art refinement performance across synthetic and experimental datasets, recovering atomic positions, thermal displacements, and thickness profiles with high fidelity. The modular architecture proposed can naturally be extended to accommodate additional physical phenomena and extended to other electron microscopy techniques. This establishes differentiable hybrid modeling as a powerful new paradigm for quantitative electron microscopy, where experimental complexities have historically limited analysis.

Early-phase renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View) and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and has broader applications in urban development and planning.

Traditional methods like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape. Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects. This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones, minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity: naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM, except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife density estimation.

Experimental analysis shows that 3D technology combined with the proposed run-time algorithm effectively reduces the Side channel vulnerability Factor (SVF) below 0.05 and the Spatial Thermal Side-channel Factor (STSF) below 0.59.

However, the data collected by these sensors is often noisy and difficult to interpret, limiting its utility for control and diagnostics. In this work, we propose a physics-informed denoising framework that integrates energy-based model and Fisher score regularization to jointly reduce data noise and enforce physical consistency with a physics-based model. The approach is first validated on benchmark problems, including the simple harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation, and Laplace's equation, across varying noise levels. We then apply the denoising framework to real thermal emission data from laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing experiments, using a trained Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) surrogate model of the LPBF process to guide denoising. Results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline neural network denoisers, effectively reducing noise under a range of LPBF processing conditions. This physics-guided denoising strategy enables robust, real-time interpretation of low-cost sensor data, facilitating predictive control and improved defect mitigation in additive manufacturing.

They also fail to model flow boiling velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular), and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

Energy management systems oversee their operation, deciding the set points of the primary control layer. This paper presents a novel 2-stage economic model predictive controller for electrified buildings including physics-based models of the battery degradation and thermal systems. The hierarchical control operates in the Dutch sequential energy markets. In particular common assumptions regarding intra-day markets (auction and continuous-time) are discussed as well as the coupling of the different storage systems. The best control policy is to co-optimize day-ahead and intra-day auctions in the first stage, to later follow intra-day auctions. If no intra-day prices are known at the time of the day-ahead auction, its best to follow continuous time intra-day in the summer and the intra-day auction in the winter. Additionally, this sequential operation increases battery degradation. Finally, under our controller the realized short-term flexibility of the thermal energy storage is marginal compared to the flexibility delivered by static battery pack and electric vehicles with bidirectional charging.

Heterogeneous systems, integrating traditional multi-core CPUs with specialized accelerators like discrete (dGPU) and integrated (iGPU) graphics processing units, offer a compelling path to navigating the trade-offs between performance and power. However, quantifying these trade-offs on widely accessible hardware remains a critical area of study. This paper presents a direct, empirical measurement of the performance and energy-to-solution of a canonical HPC workload -- a 4096x4096 matrix-matrix multiplication -- on three distinct compute architectures within a single consumer-grade laptop: a multi-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, a discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, and an integrated AMD Radeon Vega GPU. Using standard, validated, and minimally intrusive tools such as Linux perf and nvidia-smi, we find that the discrete GPU is not only the performance leader, achieving a 93.5x speedup over the CPU, but is also the most energy-efficient, consuming only 2% of the energy used by the CPU, resulting in a 50-fold improvement in energy efficiency. These findings provide a practical demonstration of the "race to idle" principle and offer clear, quantitative guidance on architectural choices for energy-aware software development.

As a result, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an increasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design schemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The authors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting thorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple acquisition functions. This is feasible due to the relatively low computational cost, compared to the expensive simulation objective. This paper addresses the shortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel heuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the various optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to regular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems. The results show the efficiency of adaptive BO when compared any worst-performing regular Bayesian schemes. As an engineering use case, the solder joint reliability problem is tackled by minimizing the accumulated non-linear creep strain under a cyclic thermal load. Results show that adaptive BO outperforms regular BO by 3% on average at any given computational budget threshold, critically saving half of the computational expense budget. This practical result underlines the methodological potential of the adaptive Bayesian data-driven methodology to achieve better results and cut optimization-related expenses. Lastly, in order to promote the reproducibility of the results, the data-driven implementations are made available on an open-source basis.

A total of 45 groups from leading research institutions and industry across the globe signed up to participate, with 18 ultimately contributing valid results that were included in the comparative study reported here.
  This paper summarizes the SPE11. A comprehensive introduction and qualitative discussion of the submitted data are provided, together with an overview of online resources for accessing the full depth of data. A global metric for analyzing the relative distance between submissions is proposed and used to conduct a quantitative analysis of the submissions. This analysis attempts to statistically resolve the key aspects influencing the variability between submissions.
  The study shows that the major qualitative variation between the submitted results is related to thermal effects, dissolution-driven convective mixing, and resolution of facies discontinuities. Moreover, a strong dependence on grid resolution is observed across all three versions of the SPE11. However, our quantitative analysis suggests that the observed variations are predominantly influenced by factors not documented in the technical responses provided by the participants. We therefore identify that unreported variations due to human choices within the process of setting up, conducting, and reporting on the simulations underlying each SPE11 submission are at least as impactful as the computational choices reported.

Existing surrogate-modelling approaches directly approximate PDE solutions but remain tied to a specific geometry, boundary conditions, and set of physical constraints. To address these limitations, we introduce a fully differentiable finite element-based machine learning (FEBML) framework that embeds trainable operators for unknown physics within a state-of-the-art, general FEM solver, enabling true end-to-end differentiation. At its core, FEBML represents each unknown operator as an encode-process-decode pipeline over finite-element degrees of freedom: field values are projected to nodal coefficients, transformed by a neural network, and then lifted back to a continuous FE function, ensuring the learned physics respects the variational structure. We demonstrate its versatility by recovering nonlinear stress-strain laws from laboratory tests, applying the learned model to a new mechanical scenario without retraining, and identifying temperature-dependent conductivity in transient heat flow.

Motivated by a privacy-preserving design, this study aims to develop a lightweight & efficient Whisper ASR system capable of running on a Raspberry Pi. Upon evaluation of the MyST corpus and by examining various filtering strategies to fine-tune the `tiny.en' model, a Word Error Rate (WER) of 15.9% was achieved (11.8% filtered). A low-rank compression reduces the encoder size by 0.51M with 1.26x faster inference in GPU, with 11% relative WER increase. During inference on Pi, the compressed version required ~2 GFLOPS fewer computations. The RTF for both the models ranged between [0.23-0.41] for various input audio durations. Analyzing the RAM usage and CPU temperature showed that the PI was capable of handling both the tiny models, however it was noticed that small models initiated additional overhead/thermal throttling.

In this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT) framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI adoption in thermal power systems.

High-fidelity control is achieved by co-simulating the optimizer with a BESS electro-thermal simulation that models spatial thermal dynamics of the battery, providing real-time State of Charge (SOC) and temperature feedback. The optimizer prioritizes reliability by enforcing power availability as a hard constraint and penalizing battery thermal derating. Within these bounds, the controller performs a Pareto sweep on the relative weights of inverter and battery losses to balance the trade-off between inverter efficiency and battery efficiency. The inverter loss model is based on an empirical lookup table (LUT) derived from a commercial inverter system, while the battery thermal loss model uses SOC and temperature-dependent internal resistance, with electric current computed from the battery Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM). When the optimization was applied to a two-string BESS, the competing effects of inverter and battery losses on system availability and thermal derating were observed. The balanced operation yielded improvements of 1% in battery efficiency, 1.5% in inverter efficiency, and 2% in derating efficiency, while maintaining higher availability. Additionally, a 5 degrees C reduction in BESS peak temperature also suggests reduced thermal stress without compromising availability.

To support Phase II of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power profiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions. Heating profiles were extracted from technical reports, interpolated onto a consistent axial mesh, validated via energy-balance checks, and encoded in machine-readable formats for benchmark compatibility.
  Classical CHF correlations exhibit substantial errors under uniform heating and degrade markedly when applied to non-uniform profiles, while modern tabular methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network trained solely on uniform data performs well in that regime but fails to generalize to spatially varying scenarios, underscoring the need for models that explicitly incorporate axial power distributions. By providing these curated datasets and baseline modeling results, this study lays the groundwork for advanced transfer-learning strategies, rigorous uncertainty quantification, and design-optimization efforts in the next phase of the CHF benchmark.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP), which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally, pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial scenarios.

However, due to the lack of visible light at night, it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we developed a high-precision visible light reflectance generative model, called Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~Î¼\mathrm{m}, 0.65~Î¼\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~Î¼\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance generation at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90, with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime generation capability was validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial progress in the ability to generate visible light reflectance at night, with the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.

Central to our analysis is a new metric, the asymptotic directional conductivity (ADC), which captures the leading-order influence of the middle surface geometry on the effective thermal conductivity in the vanishing-thickness limit. A convergence theorem is established for evaluating ADC, along with a sharp upper bound and the necessary and sufficient condition for achieving this bound. These results provide the first theoretical justification for the optimal thermal conductivity of triply periodic minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we show that ADC yields a third-order approximation to the effective conductivity of shell lattices at low volume fractions. To support practical design applications, we develop a discrete algorithm for computing and optimizing ADC over arbitrary periodic surfaces. Numerical results confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.

A key challenge in L-PBF is the formation of complex microstructures affecting product quality. We propose a physics-guided, machine-learning approach to optimize scan paths for desired microstructure outcomes, such as equiaxed grains. We utilized a phase-field method (PFM) to model crystalline grain structure evolution. To reduce computational costs, we trained a surrogate machine learning model, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network, using single-track phase-field simulations with various laser powers to predict crystalline grain orientations based on initial microstructure and thermal history. We investigated three scanning strategies across various hatch spacings within a square domain, achieving a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup using the surrogate model. To reduce trial and error in designing laser scan toolpaths, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate optimized scan paths for target microstructure. Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL approach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our DRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The reward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted microstructure from the agent's scan path. The reinforcement learning algorithm was benchmarked against conventional zigzag approach for smaller and larger domains, showing machine learning methods' potential to enhance microstructure control and computational efficiency in L-PBF optimization.

Harnessing this flexibility requires accurate modeling of the thermal dynamics of buildings, which is challenging due to their nonlinear and repetitive behavior (e.g., daily pattern), which reduce the value of historical data. To address this issue, this paper presents an HVAC management system formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP), where Neural Network (NN) models of thermal dynamics are embedded as exact mixed-integer linear constraints. We employ Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) which tunes the NN parameters to improve the HVAC performance rather than prediction metrics. However, the discrete nature of the MIQP poses challenges for this approach, as it leads to gradients that are undefined or discontinuous, thus impeding standard gradient-based training. Here, we employ Stochastic Smoothing (SS), which enables efficient gradient computation without the need to differentiate through the MIQP. Experiments on a realistic five-zone building using a high-fidelity building simulator demonstrate that the proposed SS-DFL approach outperforms conventional two-stage and relaxed DFL methods in both cost savings and grid service performance, highlighting its potential for scalable, grid-interactive building control.

Due to their low temperature level and high integration of renewables, 5GDHC systems pose new challenges for the modeling of these networks in order to simulate and test operational strategies. A particular feature is the use of uninsulated pipes, which allow energy exchange with the surrounding ground. Accurate modeling of this interaction is essential for reliable simulation and optimization. This paper presents a thermp-physical model of the pip connections, the surrounding soil, a latent heat storage in the form of an ice storage as a seasonal heat storage and the house transfer stations. The model is derived from mass and energy balances leading to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Validation is performed using field date from the 5GDHC network in Gutach-Bleibach, Germany, which supplies heating and cooling to 30 modern buildings. With an average model deviation of 4.5 % in the normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and 15.9 % in the coefficient of the variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE), the model's accuracy is validated against the available temperature measurements. The realistic representation of the thermal-hydraulic interactions between soil and pipes, as well as the heat flow within the network, confirms the accuracy of the model and its applicability for the simulation of 5GDHC systems. The model is made openly accessible under an open-source license.

Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.

This hampers real-world applicability in scenarios where current-year labels are unavailable. In addition, uncertainty quantification is often overlooked, which reduces the reliability of such approaches for operational crop monitoring. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic Thermal-Time-based Temporal Sampling (T3S) method that replaces calendar time with thermal time. By subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful way, our method highlights key periods within the growing season while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the T3S on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset covering the entirety of Switzerland, which allows us to assess all applied methods on unseen years. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our approach yields substantial improvements in classification accuracy and, critically, provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Moreover, the T3S method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With just 10% of the training labels, it outperforms the current baseline in both accuracy and uncertainty calibration, and by the end of June, it achieves a performance similar to the full-season baseline model.

Microring modulators (MRMs) are well suited for transmitters due to their compact size, high energy efficiency, and natural compatibility with dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM). However, extending beyond the recently demonstrated 200 Gb/s will require more advanced modulation formats, such as higher-order coherent modulation (e.g., QAM-16).
  In this work, we show how microring resonators (MRMs) can be efficiently used to implement phase-constant amplitude modulators and form the building blocks of a transmitter for offset QAM-16, which has been shown to simplify carrier-phase recovery relative to conventional QAM. We simulate and evaluate the performance of our proposed MRM-based coherent CPO (C2PO) transmitters using a foundry-provided commercial silicon photonics process, demonstrating an input-normalized electric field amplitude contrast of 0.64 per dimension. Through full link-level bit error rate modeling, we show that our design achieves 400 Gb/s using offset QAM-16 at a total optical laser power of 9.65 dBm-comparable to that required by conventional QAM-16 MZI-based links, despite using 10-100x less area. We further conduct a thermal simulation to assess the transmitter's thermal stability at the MRM input optical power required to meet a target BER at the desired data rates. Finally, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate 25 Gb/s MRM-based offset QAM-4 modulation with a chip fabricated in the GlobalFoundries 45 nm monolithic silicon photonics process.

This becomes especially critical when the battery is in a low state of charge under cold ambient conditions, and cabin heating and battery preconditioning (prior to actual charging) can consume a significant percentage of available energy, directly impacting the driving range. In such cases, one usually prioritizes propulsion or applies heuristic rules for thermal management, often resulting in suboptimal energy utilization. There is a pressing need for a principled approach that can dynamically allocate battery power in a way that balances thermal comfort, battery health and preconditioning, along with range preservation. This paper attempts to address this issue using real-time Model Predictive Control to optimize the power consumption between the propulsion, HVAC, and battery temperature preparation so that it can be charged immediately once the destination is reached.

However, navigating instruments--catheters and endoscopes--through anatomical pathways creates frictional interactions with luminal walls, risking complications such as perforation, poor haptic feedback, and instrument buckling. In this paper, we present a new approach to actively lubricate transluminal instruments and dynamically reduce friction with surrounding tissues. This approach employs ultrasonic vibrations, at the instrument surface, to generate a pressurized fluid layer at the contact interface, lubricating the interface and thereby reducing friction. We implemented this approach in a prototype catheter, which we validated under dry and liquid-lubricated conditions, across rigid and soft interfaces, and along varied anatomical curvatures. In a cardiac catheter use case, active lubrication reduced friction by up to 42% on ex-vivo porcine aorta tissue and 82% on rigid substrates, denoting its potential performance on healthy and calcified tissue, respectively. Thermal imaging confirmed that temperature at the tissue-catheter interface remained within safe limits. Additionally, the system effectively prevented buckling during catheter insertion experiment, further showcasing its potential. By minimizing injury risk and enhancing procedural stability, active lubrication can drastically enhance the safety and efficacy of transluminal interventions.

We introduce Fire360, a benchmark for evaluating perception and reasoning in safety-critical firefighting scenarios. The dataset includes 228 360-degree videos from professional training sessions under diverse conditions (e.g., low light, thermal distortion), annotated with action segments, object locations, and degradation metadata. Fire360 supports five tasks: Visual Question Answering, Temporal Action Captioning, Object Localization, Safety-Critical Reasoning, and Transformed Object Retrieval (TOR). TOR tests whether models can match pristine exemplars to fire-damaged counterparts in unpaired scenes, evaluating transformation-invariant recognition. While human experts achieve 83.5% on TOR, models like GPT-4o lag significantly, exposing failures in reasoning under degradation. By releasing Fire360 and its evaluation suite, we aim to advance models that not only see, but also remember, reason, and act under uncertainty.

Large language models (LLMs) offer further opportunities in polymer informatics by simplifying workflows that traditionally rely on large labeled datasets, handcrafted representations, and complex feature engineering. LLMs leverage natural language inputs through transfer learning, eliminating the need for explicit fingerprinting and streamlining training. In this study, we finetune general purpose LLMs -- open-source LLaMA-3-8B and commercial GPT-3.5 -- on a curated dataset of 11,740 entries to predict key thermal properties: glass transition, melting, and decomposition temperatures. Using parameter-efficient fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, we benchmark these models against traditional fingerprinting-based approaches -- Polymer Genome, polyGNN, and polyBERT -- under single-task (ST) and multi-task (MT) learning. We find that while LLM-based methods approach traditional models in performance, they generally underperform in predictive accuracy and efficiency. LLaMA-3 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5, likely due to its tunable open-source architecture. Additionally, ST learning proves more effective than MT, as LLMs struggle to capture cross-property correlations, a key strength of traditional methods. Analysis of molecular embeddings reveals limitations of general purpose LLMs in representing nuanced chemo-structural information compared to handcrafted features and domain-specific embeddings. These findings provide insight into the interplay between molecular embeddings and natural language processing, guiding LLM selection for polymer informatics.

To address this challenge, we present a robust intelligent control strategy that synergistically integrates an encoder-decoder physics-informed gated recurrent unit (PI-GRU) network with a model predictive control (MPC) framework. Our methodology incorporates physical soft constraints into the neural network architecture, yielding a predictive model with enhanced physical consistency that demonstrates robust extrapolation capabilities beyond the training data distribution. Leveraging the PI-GRU model's accurate multi-step predictive performance, we implement a hierarchical parallel MPC architecture capable of real-time thermal instability compensation. This hybrid approach achieves cross-domain consistent thermal stabilization in TAs under diverse laser power operations. Remarkably, while trained exclusively on low-power operational data, our system demonstrates exceptional generalization, improving prediction accuracy by 58.2% and temperature stability by 69.1% in previously unseen high-power operating regimes, as experimentally validated. The novel synchronization of physics-informed neural networks with advanced MPC frameworks presented in this work establishes a groundbreaking paradigm for addressing robustness challenges in cross-domain predictive control applications, overcoming conventional modeling limitations.

Specifically, we design view-dependent deformation field that leverages camera position and viewing direction, which capture thermal variations. Furthermore, we introduce the Thermal Feature Extractor (TFE) and MonoSSIM loss, which consider appearance, edge, and frequency to maintain robustness.

Current state-of-the-art QC use a great quantity of cables to connect the physical qubits, situated in the cryogenic temperature, to room temperature electronics. Integrated cryogenic electronics together with semiconductor spin qubits is one way closer for scalability. Such a scalable quantum computer can have qubits and the control electronics at 4K stage. Being at 4K, more thermal dissipation is allowed without overloading the cooling capability of the fridge. Still, control and power circuitry is expected to be highly efficient. While commercial CMOS technologies are found to be operatable at \qty{}{mK}, lack of reliable cryogenic models while designing, increased mismatches at cryo temperatures makes the design challenging and risky. Using an FDSOI technology with backgate biasing to compensate for the threshold voltage drift happening at cryo~(compensating around 200mV) and digital circuitry is a way to address this challenge. In this work, a self-clocked digital low dropout regulator (DLDO) is designed in FDSOI for high power efficient, variation tolerant regulator to supply cryogenic circuits for Quantum computing. The proposed digital LDO is more resilient to mismatch and having self clocking and close and fine loops addresses the power efficiency and faster transient response.

Infrared-visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from infrared and visible images to generate a high-quality fused image. Existing methods exhibit critical limitations such as neglecting color structure information in visible images and performance degradation when processing low-quality color-visible inputs. To address these issues, we propose a quaternion infrared-visible image fusion (QIVIF) framework to generate high-quality fused images completely in the quaternion domain. QIVIF proposes a quaternion low-visibility feature learning model to adaptively extract salient thermal targets and fine-grained texture details from input infrared and visible images respectively under diverse degraded conditions. QIVIF then develops a quaternion adaptive unsharp masking method to adaptively improve high-frequency feature enhancement with balanced illumination. QIVIF further proposes a quaternion hierarchical Bayesian fusion model to integrate infrared saliency and enhanced visible details to obtain high-quality fused images. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our QIVIF surpasses state-of-the-art methods under challenging low-visibility conditions.

This paper introduces SAM-TIFF, a novel teacher-student distillation framework for pixel-level wildfire temperature prediction and segmentation using RGB input only. A multimodal teacher network trained on paired RGB-Thermal imagery and radiometric TIFF ground truth distills knowledge to a unimodal RGB student network, enabling thermal-sensor-free inference. Segmentation supervision is generated using a hybrid approach of segment anything (SAM)-guided mask generation, and selection via TOPSIS, along with Canny edge detection and Otsu's thresholding pipeline for automatic point prompt selection. Our method is the first to perform per-pixel temperature regression from RGB UAV data, demonstrating strong generalization on the recent FLAME 3 dataset. This work lays the foundation for lightweight, cost-effective UAV-based wildfire monitoring systems without thermal sensors.

While computational methods offer spatiotemporal resolution in idealized cases, replicating complex experimental conditions remains prohibitively difficult. Here, we present a data-driven framework that leverages a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to infer temperature fields from geometric phase contours in a canonical pool boiling configuration where advanced data collection techniques are restricted. Using high-speed imaging data and simulation-informed training, our model demonstrates the ability to reconstruct temperature fields with errors below 6%. We further show that standard data augmentation strategies are effective in enhancing both accuracy and physical plausibility of the predicted maps across both simulation and experimental datasets when precise physical constraints are not applicable. Our results highlight the potential of deep generative models to bridge the gap between observable multiphase phenomena and underlying thermal transport, offering a powerful approach to augment and interpret experimental measurements in complex two-phase systems.

Here, we investigate the use of the Second Moment Method (SMM) to accelerate absorption-emission within the context of the multigroup, Discrete Ordinates transport equations with discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization. SMM employs a reduced-dimensional, diffusion-based model of radiation transport that, when coupled with suitable discrete closures, serves as a proxy for the transport equation, isolating the transport equation from the stiff absorption-emission physics. We use a gray low-order system to reduce the cost of solving the low-order system and leverage SMM low-order discretizations specifically designed to be scalably solvable with existing linear solver technology. Our algorithm robustly resolves the nonlinear TRT system while only relying on transport sweeps, linearly solving symmetric and positive definite, gray diffusion systems, and nonlinearly solving the spatially pointwise energy balance equation. This algorithm is used as a vehicle to compare the efficacy of low-order discretizations developed for steady-state, linear transport on gray and multigroup TRT problems in one and two spatial dimensions.

ML models trained on experimental data reveals that increasing Si and B content reduces MS from 1.81T (DFT~2.04 T) to ~1.54 T (DFT~1.56T) in Fe-Si-B, which is attributed to decreased magnetic density and structural modifications. Experimental validation of ML predicted magnetic saturation on Fe-1Si-1B (2.09T), Fe-5Si-5B (2.01T) and Fe-10Si-10B (1.54T) alloy compositions further support our findings. These trends are consistent with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, which link increased electronic disorder and band broadening to lower MS values. Experimental validation on selected alloys confirms the predictive accuracy of the ML model, with good agreement across compositions. Beyond predictive accuracy, detailed uncertainty quantification and model interpretability including through feature importance and partial dependence analysis reveals that MS is governed by a nonlinear interplay between Fe content, early transition metal ratios, and annealing temperature, while HC is more sensitive to processing conditions such as ribbon thickness and thermal treatment windows. The ML framework was further applied to Fe-Si-B/Cr/Cu/Zr/Nb alloys in a pseudo-quaternary compositional space, which shows comparable magnetic properties to NANOMET (Fe84.8Si0.5B9.4Cu0.8 P3.5C1), FINEMET (Fe73.5Si13.5B9 Cu1Nb3), NANOPERM (Fe88Zr7B4Cu1), and HITPERM (Fe44Co44Zr7B4Cu1.

Monitoring the internal temperatures of motors and keeping them under their thresholds is an important first step. Conventional modeling methods require expert knowledge and complicated mathematical approaches. With all the data a modern electric drive collects nowadays during the system operation, it is feasible to apply data-driven approaches for estimating thermal behaviors. In this paper, multiple machine-learning methods are investigated on their capability to approximate the temperatures of the stator winding and bearing in induction motors. The explored algorithms vary from linear to neural networks. For this reason, experimental lab data have been captured from a powertrain under predetermined operating conditions. For each approach, a hyperparameter search is then performed to find the optimal configuration. All the models are evaluated by various metrics, and it has been found that neural networks perform satisfactorily even under transient conditions.

Many cable-driven exosuits have been developed but little has been published on their electromechanical designs and performance. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive design and performance analysis of a two degree of freedom tendon driver unit (TDU) for cable-driven wearable exosuits. Detailed methodologies are presented to benchmark the functionality of the TDU. A static torque output test compares the commanded and measured torques. A velocity control test evaluates the attenuation and phase shift across velocities. A noise test evaluates how loud the TDU is for the wearer under different speeds. A thermal stress test captures the cooling performance of the TDU to ensure safe operation at higher loads. Finally, a battery endurance test evaluates the runtime of the TDU under various loading conditions to inform the usable time. To demonstrate these tests, a modular TDU system for cable-driven applications is introduced, which allows components such as motors, pulleys, and sensors to be adapted based on the requirements of the intended application. By sharing detailed methodologies and performance results, this study aims to provide a TDU design that may be leveraged by others and resources for researchers and engineers to better document the capabilities of their TDU designs.

Integrating machine learning (ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly collected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial systems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern electric drives has been used to develop a data-driven thermal model of a power module. A test bench has been designed and used specifically for training and validating the thermal digital twin undergoing various static and dynamic operating profiles. Different approaches, from traditional linear models to deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for estimating the case temperature of a power module. Several evaluation metrics were then used to assess the investigated methods' performance and implementation in industrial embedded systems.

This approach inherently addresses challenges such as varying operating conditions, data sharing limitations, and security implications. The framework starts with a base model that is incrementally adapted by multiple clients via adapting three state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques: Fine-tuning, Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), and Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA). The Flower framework is employed for FL, using Federated Averaging for aggregation. Validation with field data demonstrates that fine-tuning offers a straightforward TL approach with high accuracy, making it suitable for practical applications. Benchmarking results reveal a comprehensive comparison of these methods, showcasing their respective strengths and weaknesses when applied in different scenarios. Locally hosted FL enhances performance when data aggregation is not feasible, while cloud-based FL becomes more practical with a significant increase in the number of clients, addressing scalability and connectivity challenges.

In this article, we propose a new asymptotic-preserving scheme based on the Unified Gas Kinetic Scheme (UGKS) for this model in two-dimensional space. This finite volume kinetic scheme follows the same approach as in our previous article and relies on a moment closure, at the numerical scale, of the microscopic flux of UGKS. The method is developed for both structured and unstructured meshes, and several techniques are introduced to ensure accurate fluxes in the diffusion limit. A second-order extension is also proposed. Several test cases validate the different aspects of the scheme and demonstrate its efficiency in multiscale simulations. In particular, the results demonstrate that this method accurately captures non-local thermal effects.

However, due to the limitations of RGB sensors, existing methods often struggle to achieve reliable performance in harsh environments, such as heavy rain and low-light conditions. Furthermore, we observe that ground truth depth maps often suffer from large missing measurements in adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, leading to insufficient supervision. In contrast, thermal cameras are known for providing clear and reliable visibility in such conditions, yet research on thermal-LiDAR depth completion remains underexplored. Moreover, the characteristics of thermal images, such as blurriness, low contrast, and noise, bring unclear depth boundary problems. To address these challenges, we first evaluate the feasibility and robustness of thermal-LiDAR depth completion across diverse lighting (eg., well-lit, low-light), weather (eg., clear-sky, rainy), and environment (eg., indoor, outdoor) conditions, by conducting extensive benchmarks on the MS$^2$ and ViViD datasets. In addition, we propose a framework that utilizes COntrastive learning and Pseudo-Supervision (COPS) to enhance depth boundary clarity and improve completion accuracy by leveraging a depth foundation model in two key ways. First, COPS enforces a depth-aware contrastive loss between different depth points by mining positive and negative samples using a monocular depth foundation model to sharpen depth boundaries. Second, it mitigates the issue of incomplete supervision from ground truth depth maps by leveraging foundation model predictions as dense depth priors. We also provide in-depth analyses of the key challenges in thermal-LiDAR depth completion to aid in understanding the task and encourage future research.

For that purpose, several models have been developed at the district scale. At this scale, the outside surface energy budget is detailed, however building models are very simplified and considered as a boundary condition of the district scale model. This shortcoming inhibits the opportunity to investigate the effect of urban microclimate on the inside building conditions. The aim of this work is to improve the representation of the physical phenomena involved in the building models of a district model. For that purpose, the model integrates inside and outside fully detailed long-wave radiative flux. The numerical model is based on finite differences to solve conduction through all the surfaces and the radiosity method to solve long-wave radiative heat fluxes inside and outside. Calculated temperatures and heat fluxes are evaluated with respect to \textit{in situ} measurements from an experimental demonstrator over 14 sensors and a 24-day period. Results are also compared to state-of-the-art models simulation tool show improvement of the RMSE of $0.9 \ \mathsf{^{\,\circ}C}$ to $2.1 \ \mathsf{^{\,\circ}C}$ on the surface temperature modeled.

A crucial step in the design process is the rapid evaluation of their effective mechanical, thermal, or, in general, constitutive properties. The established procedure is to use forward models that accept microstructure geometry and local constitutive properties as inputs. The classical simulation-based approach, which uses, e.g., finite elements and FFT-based solvers, can require substantial computational resources. At the same time, simulation-based models struggle to provide gradients with respect to the microstructure and the constitutive parameters. Such gradients are, however, of paramount importance for microstructure design and for inverting the microstructure-property mapping. Machine learning surrogates can excel in these situations. However, they can lead to unphysical predictions that violate essential bounds on the constitutive response, such as the upper (Voigt-like) or the lower (Reuss-like) bound in linear elasticity. Therefore, we propose a novel spectral normalization scheme that a priori enforces these bounds. The approach is fully agnostic with respect to the chosen microstructural features and the utilized surrogate model. All of these will automatically and strictly predict outputs that obey the upper and lower bounds by construction. The technique can be used for any constitutive tensor that is symmetric and where upper and lower bounds (in the LÃ¶wner sense) exist, i.e., for permeability, thermal conductivity, linear elasticity, and many more. We demonstrate the use of spectral normalization in the Voigt-Reuss net using a simple neural network. Numerical examples on truly extensive datasets illustrate the improved accuracy, robustness, and independence of the type of input features in comparison to much-used neural networks.

This study explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for real-time drum control in microreactors, exploring performance in regard to load-following scenarios. By leveraging a point kinetics model with thermal and xenon feedback, we first establish a baseline using a single-output RL agent, then compare it against a traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. This study demonstrates that RL controllers, including both single- and multi-agent RL (MARL) frameworks, can achieve similar or even superior load-following performance as traditional PID control across a range of load-following scenarios. In short transients, the RL agent was able to reduce the tracking error rate in comparison to PID. Over extended 300-minute load-following scenarios in which xenon feedback becomes a dominant factor, PID maintained better accuracy, but RL still remained within a 1% error margin despite being trained only on short-duration scenarios. This highlights RL's strong ability to generalize and extrapolate to longer, more complex transients, affording substantial reductions in training costs and reduced overfitting. Furthermore, when control was extended to multiple drums, MARL enabled independent drum control as well as maintained reactor symmetry constraints without sacrificing performance -- an objective that standard single-agent RL could not learn. We also found that, as increasing levels of Gaussian noise were added to the power measurements, the RL controllers were able to maintain lower error rates than PID, and to do so with less control effort.

Increasing urbanization rate causes an urban heat island (UHI) effect, which strongly depends on the short- and long-wave radiation balance heat flux between the surfaces. In order to calculate accurately this heat flux, it is required to assess the surface temperature which depends on the knowledge of the thermal properties and the surface heat transfer coefficients in the heat transfer problem. The aim of this paper is to estimate the thermal properties of the ground and the time varying surface heat transfer coefficient by solving an inverse problem. The Dufort--Frankel scheme is applied for solving the unsteady heat transfer problem. For the inverse problem, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the posterior probability density function of unknown parameters within the Bayesian framework of statistics, by applying the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for random sample generation. Actual temperature measurements available at different ground depths were used for the solution of the inverse problem. Different time discretizations were examined for the transient heat transfer coefficient at the ground surface, which then involved different prior distributions. Results of different case studies show that the estimated values of the unknown parameters were in accordance with literature values. Moreover, with the present solution of the inverse problem the temperature residuals were smaller than those obtained by using literature values for the unknowns.

This has led to complex engines with a surge in the number of corresponding tunable parameters in actuator set points and control settings. Automated calibration is therefore essential to keep development time and costs at acceptable levels. In this work, an innovative self-learning calibration method is presented based on in-cylinder pressure curve shaping. This method combines Principal Component Decomposition with constrained Bayesian Optimization. To realize maximal thermal engine efficiency, the optimization problem aims at minimizing the difference between the actual in-cylinder pressure curve and an Idealized Thermodynamic Cycle. By continuously updating a Gaussian Process Regression model of the pressure's Principal Components weights using measurements of the actual operating conditions, the mean in-cylinder pressure curve as well as its uncertainty bounds are learned. This information drives the optimization of calibration parameters, which are automatically adapted while dealing with the risks and uncertainties associated with operational safety and combustion stability. This data-driven method does not require prior knowledge of the system. The proposed method is successfully demonstrated in simulation using a Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition engine model. The difference between the Gross Indicated Efficiency of the optimal solution found and the true optimum is 0.017%. For this complex engine, the optimal solution was found after 64.4s, which is relatively fast compared to conventional calibration methods.

While VLMs have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual reasoning and multimodal understanding, their evaluation has been predominantly limited to RGB-based benchmarks, leaving a critical gap in assessing their capabilities in infrared vision tasks. Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding.

Nevertheless, existing RGB-T semantic segmentation models typically depend on simple addition or concatenation strategies or ignore the differences between information at different levels. To address these issues, we proposed a novel RGB-T road scene semantic segmentation network called Brain-Inspired Multi-Iteration Interaction Network (BIMII-Net). First, to meet the requirements of accurate texture and local information extraction in road scenarios like autonomous driving, we proposed a deep continuous-coupled neural network (DCCNN) architecture based on a brain-inspired model. Second, to enhance the interaction and expression capabilities among multi-modal information, we designed a cross explicit attention-enhanced fusion module (CEAEF-Module) in the feature fusion stage of BIMII-Net to effectively integrate features at different levels. Finally, we constructed a complementary interactive multi-layer decoder structure, incorporating the shallow-level feature iteration module (SFI-Module), the deep-level feature iteration module (DFI-Module), and the multi-feature enhancement module (MFE-Module) to collaboratively extract texture details and global skeleton information, with multi-module joint supervision further optimizing the segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate that BIMII-Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the brain-inspired computing domain and outperforms most existing RGB-T semantic segmentation methods. It also exhibits strong generalization capabilities on multiple RGB-T datasets, proving the effectiveness of brain-inspired computer models in multi-modal image segmentation tasks.

It is developed by SpaceDot, a volunteer, interdisciplinary student team at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and supported by the "Fly Your Satellite! 3" program of the European Space Agency (ESA) Education Office.
  The nanosatellite features an in-house designed on-board computer subsystem responsible for telecommand execution, telemetry fetching, onboard time synchronization, in-orbit patching, and fault recovery. The subsystem is designed on one PC/104 standard compatible Printed Circuit Board (PCB) that hosts the On-board Computer (OBC) on the one side and the Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS) on the other, and it is compatible with the LibreCube standard. The hosted subsystems are functionally isolated and feature an ARM Cortex-M7, radiation-tolerant microcontroller each.
  Before sending anything to space thorough testing is required and specifically the on-board computer board underwent vibration and thermal cycling tests to ensure nominal operation in all conditions.
  This paper aims to elucidate the decision-making process, design iterations, and development stages of the custom board and accompanying in-house software. Insights garnered from the initial partially successful environmental test campaign at the ESA CubeSat Support Facility will be shared, along with the ensuing preparations, results, and lessons learned from subsequent testing endeavors in April 2024. Furthermore, the current developmental status will be discussed alongside future electromagnetic compatibility testing, integration plan on a FlatSat, and prospects for the open-source design as a cost-effective, and modular solution that can be tailored with little effort for upcoming missions.

As such, energy management systems seek to decide the power dispatch in the best way possible. The objective is to minimize and balance operative costs (energy bills or asset degradation) with user requirements (mobility, heating, etc.). Current energy management uses empirical battery ageing models outside of their specific fitting conditions, resulting in inaccuracies and poor performance. Moreover, the link to thermal systems is also overlooked. This paper presents an ageing-aware day-ahead algorithm for electrified buildings that incorporates physics-based battery ageing models. The models distinguish between energy storage systems and make explicit the trade-off between grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed day-ahead algorithm can either cut down on grid costs or extend battery lifetime (electric vehicle or stationary battery packs). Moreover, it exploits the differences between cathode chemistries improving grid costs by 25% when using LFP cells, with respect to NMC cells. Finally, the performance using aged batteries is also enhanced with 35% grid cost observed savings, when passing from new to aged batteries in the summer.

However, FOWLP faces manufacturing challenges such as coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch, warpage, die shift, and post-molding protrusion, causing misalignment and bonding issues during redistribution layer (RDL) buildup. Moreover, the organic nature of the package exposes it to severe thermo-mechanical stresses during fabrication and operation. In order to address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive defect analysis and testing framework for FOWLP interconnects. We use Ansys Q3D to map defects to equivalent electrical circuit models and perform fault simulations to investigate the impacts of these defects on chiplet functionality. Additionally, we present a built-in self-test (BIST) architecture to detect stuck-at and bridging faults while accurately diagnosing the fault type and location. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed BIST solution and provide critical insights for optimizing design decisions in packages, balancing fault detection and diagnosis with the cost of testability insertion.

The design prioritizes enhanced locomotion capabilities, improved reliability and safety of the actuation system, and simplified, cost-effective manufacturing processes. Locomotion performance is optimized through a sandwiched leg design and a dual-motor configuration, reducing leg inertia for agile movements. Reliability and safety are achieved by integrating robust cable strain reliefs, efficient heat sinks for motor thermal management, and mechanical limits to restrict leg motion. Simplified design considerations include a quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuator and the adoption of low-cost fabrication techniques, such as laser cutting and 3D printing, to minimize cost and ensure rapid prototyping. The robot weighs approximately 25 kg and is developed at a cost under \$8000, making it a scalable and affordable solution for robotics research. Experimental validations demonstrate the platform's capability to execute trot and crawl gaits on flat terrain and slopes, highlighting its potential as a versatile and reliable quadruped research platform.

This study introduces a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to optimize the battery discharging process during pre-treatment, ensuring both efficiency and safety. The proposed method explicitly incorporates temperature constraints to prevent overheating and potential hazards. By leveraging a control-oriented equivalent circuit model integrated with thermal dynamics, the MPC algorithm dynamically adjusts the discharging profile to maintain safe operating temperatures. Additionally, the robust controller is designed to account for model mismatches between the nonlinear battery dynamics and the linearized model, ensuring reliable performance under varying conditions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through simulations comparing the robust MPC method with conventional discharging strategies, including constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) and constant current-constant temperature (CC-CT) methods. Results indicate that the robust MPC framework significantly reduces discharging time while adhering to safety constraints, offering a promising solution for the recycling and second-life applications of lithium-ion batteries.

Due to the intricate thermal interactions between land, sea, and atmosphere, the spatial gradients of SST in coastal waters often appear at finer spatial scales than those in open ocean waters. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first analysed the spatiotemporal patterns of SST in South Australia's temperate coastal waters from 2014 to 2023 by developing an operational approach for SST retrieval from the Landsat-8 TIRS sensor. A buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to validate the quality of SST retrievals. Then the daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months. We hope these findings would be helpful in supporting the fishing and aquaculture industries in the coastal waters of South Australia.

However, the practical application of MLOPT in industrial settings is often hindered by a lack of domain compliance and system-specific consistency, resulting in suboptimal solutions with limited real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop (HITL) constraint-based optimisation framework that integrates domain expertise with data-driven methods, ensuring solutions are both technically sound and operationally feasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through a case study focused on enhancing the thermal efficiency and reducing the turbine heat rate of a 660 MW supercritical coal-fired power plant. By embedding domain knowledge as constraints within the optimisation process, our approach yields solutions that align with the plant's operational patterns and are seamlessly integrated into its control systems. Empirical validation confirms a mean improvement in thermal efficiency of 0.64\% and a mean reduction in turbine heat rate of 93 kJ/kWh. Scaling our analysis to 59 global coal power plants with comparable capacity and fuel type, we estimate a cumulative lifetime reduction of 156.4 million tons of carbon emissions. These results underscore the transformative potential of our HITL-MLOPT framework in delivering domain-compliant, implementable solutions for industrial decarbonisation, offering a scalable pathway to mitigate the environmental impact of coal-based power generation worldwide.

In the pursuit of ultimate resolution, we introduce Peak Probability Presentations ($P^3$)- a statistical spectral representation that assigns a probability to each spectral point, indicating the likelihood of a peak maximum occurring at that location. The mapping between the spectrum and $P^3$ is achieved using MR-Ai, a physics-inspired deep learning neural network architecture, designed to handle multidimensional NMR spectra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MR-Ai enables coprocessing of multiple spectra, facilitating direct information exchange between datasets. This feature significantly enhances spectral quality, particularly in cases of highly sparse sampling. Performance of MR-Ai and high value of the $P^3$ are demonstrated on the synthetic data and spectra of Tau, MATL1, Calmodulin, and several other proteins.

However, many existing approaches overlook critical factors such as parallelism, compute intensity, and heterogeneous core types. In this paper, we introduce a statistical learning approach for feature selection that identifies the most influential features - such as core type, speed, temperature, and application-level parallelism or memory intensity - for accurate environment modeling and efficient energy optimization. Our experiments, conducted with state-of-the-art Linux governors and thermal modeling techniques, show that correlation-aware task-to-core allocation lowers energy consumption by up to 10% and reduces core temperature by up to 5 degrees Celsius compared to random core selection. Furthermore, our compressed, bootstrapped regression model improves thermal prediction accuracy by 6% while cutting model parameters by 16%, yielding an overall mean square error reduction of 61.6% relative to existing approaches. We provided results based on superscalar Intel Core i7 12th Gen processors with 14 cores, but validated our method across a diverse set of hardware platforms and effectively balanced performance, power, and thermal demands through statistical feature evaluation.

A team of three robots and a base station will autonomously explore a region near the lander, collecting the data required for 3D reconstruction of the surface with no human input; and then autonomously perform distributed sensing with multi-static ground penetrating radars (GPR), driving in formation while performing coordinated radar soundings to create a map of the subsurface. At the core of CADRE's software architecture is a novel autonomous, distributed planning, scheduling, and execution (PS&E) system. The system coordinates the robots' activities, planning and executing tasks that require multiple robots' participation while ensuring that each individual robot's thermal and power resources stay within prescribed bounds, and respecting ground-prescribed sleep-wake cycles. The system uses a centralized-planning, distributed-execution paradigm, and a leader election mechanism ensures robustness to failures of individual agents. In this paper, we describe the architecture of CADRE's PS&E system; discuss its design rationale; and report on verification and validation (V&V) testing of the system on CADRE's hardware in preparation for deployment on the Moon.

However, these perspectives often overlook the critical interplay between AI-specific load transients and power electronics. This paper addresses that gap by examining how large-scale AI workloads impose unique demands on power conversion chains and, in turn, how the power electronics themselves shape the dynamic behavior of AI-based infrastructure. We illustrate the fundamental constraints imposed by multi-stage power conversion architectures and highlight the key role of final-stage modules in defining realistic power slew rates for GPU clusters. Our analysis shows that traditional designs, optimized for slower-varying or CPU-centric workloads, may not adequately accommodate the rapid load ramps and drops characteristic of AI accelerators. To bridge this gap, we present insights into advanced converter topologies, hierarchical control methods, and energy buffering techniques that collectively enable robust and efficient power delivery. By emphasizing the bidirectional influence between AI workloads and power electronics, we hope this work can set a good starting point and offer practical design considerations to ensure future exascale-capable data centers can meet the stringent performance, reliability, and scalability requirements of next-generation AI deployments.

We model the system as a lossy thermal noise bosonic channel in which the location of the target, modeled as a beamsplitter, affects the timing of the backscattered signal. Motivated by the envisioned deployment of entanglement sharing quantum networks, we allow the transmitter to exploit entanglement to assist its sensing and communication. Since entanglement is known to enhance sensing, as known from quantum illumination, and increase communication rates, as known from the characterization of the entanglement-assisted capacity, the transmitter is faced with a trade-off and must judiciously allocate its entanglement resources. Our main result is a characterization of the trade-offs incurred in the form of an achievable rate/error-exponent region which can beat time-sharing in certain cases. The proof of our result relies on technical results of independent interests, by which we carefully show how to extend the known asymptotic characterization of multi-hypothesis testing Chernoff exponent in finite-dimensional spaces to infinite-dimensional spaces and provide a characterization of phase shift keying modulated displaced thermal states in Fock basis.

However, automation of the inspection task is a challenging problem as it requires precise navigation to capture images from optimal distances and viewing angles.
  This paper presents a novel localization pipeline that directly integrates PV module detection with UAV navigation, allowing precise positioning during inspection. Detections are used to identify the power plant structures in the image and associate these with the power plant model. We define visually recognizable anchor points for the initial association and use object tracking to discern global associations. We present three distinct methods for visual segmentation of PV modules based on traditional computer vision, deep learning, and their fusion, and we evaluate their performance in relation to the proposed localization pipeline.
  The presented methods were verified and evaluated using custom aerial inspection data sets, demonstrating their robustness and applicability for real-time navigation. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of the power plant model's precision on the localization methods.

Additionally, the thermal contact resistance at the interfaces between each pair of materials is taken into account. The problem is mathematically modeled, and explicit analytical solutions are derived using Fourier techniques. A convergent finite difference scheme is also formulated to simulate specific cases. The solution is consistent with previous results. A numerical example is provided, demonstrating the coherence between the obtained results and the physical behavior of the problem. This work was recently published for a two-layer body; the generalization to m-layer bodies allows for conclusions that enhance the theoretical understanding of heat transfer in multilayer materials and may contribute to improving the thermal design of multilayer engineering systems.

This study introduces an AI-driven framework that integrates machine learning models (MLMs) and explainable AI techniques to optimize Sky View Factor (SVF) and visibility, key spatial metrics influencing thermal comfort and perceived safety in urban spaces. Unlike global optimization methods, which are computationally intensive and impractical for localized adjustments, this framework supports incremental design improvements with lower computational costs and greater flexibility. The framework employs SHapley Adaptive Explanations (SHAP) to analyze feature importance and Counterfactual Explanations (CFXs) to propose minimal design changes. Simulations tested five MLMs, identifying XGBoost as the most accurate, with building width, park area, and heights of surrounding buildings as critical for SVF, and distances from southern buildings as key for visibility. Compared to Genetic Algorithms, which required approximately 15/30 minutes across 3/4 generations to converge, the tested CFX approach achieved optimized results in 1 minute with a 5% RMSE error, demonstrating significantly faster performance and suitability for scalable retrofitting strategies. This interpretable and computationally efficient framework advances urban performance optimization, providing data-driven insights and practical retrofitting solutions for enhancing usability and environmental quality across diverse urban contexts.

However, DDSS development requires complex and costly customized designs tailored to various tasks during the modeling process. Moreover, DDSS are constrained to a single structured data modality, limiting their ability to incorporate additional contextual knowledge. Furthermore, DDSSs' limited representation learning leads to weak predictive performance with scarce data. To address these challenges, we propose a general framework named LLM-TKESS (large language model for text-based knowledge-embedded soft sensing), harnessing the powerful general problem-solving capabilities, cross-modal knowledge transfer abilities, and few-shot capabilities of LLM for enhanced soft sensing modeling. Specifically, an auxiliary variable series encoder (AVS Encoder) is proposed to unleash LLM's potential for capturing temporal relationships within series and spatial semantic relationships among auxiliary variables. Then, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning alignment strategy: in the first stage, employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning through autoregressive training adjusts LLM to rapidly accommodate process variable data, resulting in a soft sensing foundation model (SSFM). Subsequently, by training adapters, we adapt the SSFM to various downstream tasks without modifying its architecture. Then, we propose two text-based knowledge-embedded soft sensors, integrating new natural language modalities to overcome the limitations of pure structured data models. Furthermore, benefiting from LLM's pre-existing world knowledge, our model demonstrates outstanding predictive capabilities in small sample conditions. Using the thermal deformation of air preheater rotor as a case study, we validate through extensive experiments that LLM-TKESS exhibits outstanding performance.

Many solutions focus on tags characterized by optical features that are partially or completely camouflaged to the human eye, thus discouraging scammers. In this paper, a QR code is laser printed on a thin plastic foil previously coated by a specific nanocavity consisting of a metal/insulator/metal/insulator (MIMI) multilayer. This metamaterial possesses unique features in terms of light transmission that are due to the specific design. A thin layer of polymer dispersed liquid crystals, fabricated incorporating specific nematic liquid crystals in a polymer matrix, is able to camouflage the QR code that becomes, then, readable only under specific thermal conditions. Three anti-counterfeiting tags were fabricated, each using a distinct LC with its own nematic-isotropic transition temperature. The peculiar combination of the unique optical properties of nematic liquid crystals and optical nanocavities results in the creation of a novel type of tags showing two different encoding levels. Stress tests including water immersion, bending test, and prolonged heating have been performed ensuring the long-term stability of the tags. The realized two security-level anti-counterfeiting tags are cost-effective, straightforward to manufacture and, thanks to their flexibility, can be easily integrated into packaging and products.

In the offline phase, the method constructs, through a component-wise empirical training, a library of archetype components defined by a component-wise reduced basis and hyperreduced quadrature rules with varying hyperreduction fidelities. In the online phase, the method applies an online adaptive scheme informed by the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart theorem to select an appropriate hyperreduction fidelity for each component to meet the user-prescribed error tolerance at the system level. The method accommodates the rapid construction of hyperreduced models for large-scale component-based nonlinear systems and enables model reduction of problems with many continuous and topology-varying parameters. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated on a two-dimensional nonlinear thermal fin system that comprises up to 225 components and 68 independent parameters.

However, the socio-economic impacts of space weather hazards, such as from geomagnetic storms, remain under-researched. This study introduces a novel framework to estimate the economic impacts of electricity transmission infrastructure failure due to space weather. By integrating existing geophysical and geomagnetically induced current (GIC) estimation models with a newly developed geospatial model of the Continental United States power grid, GIC vulnerabilities are assessed for a range of space weather scenarios. The approach evaluates multiple power network architectures, incorporating input-output economic modeling to translate business and population disruptions into macroeconomic impacts from GIC-related thermal heating failures. The results indicate a daily GDP loss from 6 billion USD to over 10 billion USD. Even under conservative GIC thresholds (75 A/ph) aligned with thermal withstand limits from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), significant economic disruptions are evident. This study is limited by its restriction to thermal heating analysis, though GICs can also affect the grid through other pathways, such as voltage instability and harmonic distortions. Addressing these other failure mechanisms need to be the focus of future research.

This report proposes an effective approach to address this challenging issue, in which the current change, state of charge and resistance are considered simultaneously to depict the voltage differential envelope curve. The envelope naturally utilizes the inherent physical information of the battery and accounts for error interference, providing a high-precision range for battery voltage fluctuations under any operating conditions. This study validates the algorithm using data from 10 fault intervals under dynamic operating condition. The results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves 100% accuracy and responds rapidly, enabling timely detection of early-stage internal short circuit faults in batteries. Compared to signal processing-based and neural network methods, the proposed approach offers significant advantages in both accuracy and practicality, making it highly relevant for the safe application and widespread adoption of lithium-ion batteries.

Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.

Cavitation is modeled using the homogeneous equilibrium model. The mechanical and thermodynamic constitutive behavior of the lubricant is accurately captured by inclusion of compressibility, lubricant rheology and thermal effects. Different constitutive models can be selected at run time, through the adoption of the modular approach of OpenFOAM. By combining the lubricant solver with a structural solver using a coupling tool, elastohydrodynamically lubricated contacts can be accurately simulated in a partitioned way. The solution approach is validated and examples with different slip conditions are included. The benefit for the OpenFOAM community of this work is the creation of a new solver for lubricant flow in challenging conditions and at the same the illustration of combining OpenFOAM solvers with other open-source software packages.

Because of their infrequent occurrence and the huge number of degrees of freedom in molecular systems, understanding the physical properties that drive rare events is immensely difficult. A common approach to this problem is to propose a collective variable (CV) that describes this process by a simplified representation. However, choosing CVs is not easy, as it often relies on physical intuition. Machine learning (ML) techniques provide a promising approach for effectively extracting optimal CVs from MD data. Here, we provide a note on a recent unsupervised ML method called spectral map, which constructs CVs by maximizing the timescale separation between slow and fast variables in the system.

Radiometric imaging provides per-pixel temperature estimates, a valuable improvement over non-radiometric data that requires irradiance measurements to be converted into visible images using RGB color palettes. Despite its benefits, this technology has been underutilized largely due to a lack of available data for researchers. This study addresses this gap by introducing methods for collecting and processing synchronized visual spectrum and radiometric thermal imagery using UAVs at prescribed fires. The included imagery processing pipeline drastically simplifies and partially automates each step from data collection to neural network input. Further, we present the FLAME 3 dataset, the first comprehensive collection of side-by-side visual spectrum and radiometric thermal imagery of wildland fires. Building on our previous FLAME 1 and FLAME 2 datasets, FLAME 3 includes radiometric thermal Tag Image File Format (TIFFs) and nadir thermal plots, providing a new data type and collection method. This dataset aims to spur a new generation of machine learning models utilizing radiometric thermal imagery, potentially trivializing tasks such as aerial wildfire detection, segmentation, and assessment. A single-burn subset of FLAME 3 for computer vision applications is available on Kaggle with the full 6 burn set available to readers upon request.

Compared to conventional analytical design methods, topology optimization allows handling arbitrary geometries, boundary conditions and design requirements; and producing alternate designs for non-unique problems. Additionally, as far as the design of meta-structures is concerned, topology optimization does not need intuition-based coordinate transformation or the form invariance of governing equations, as in the case of transformation thermotics. We explore isogeometric density-based topology optimization in the continuous setting, which perfectly aligns with FGMs. In this formulation, the density field, geometry and solution of the governing equations are parameterized using non-uniform rational basis spline entities. Accordingly, the heat conduction problem is solved using Isogeometric Analysis. We design various 2D & 3D thermal meta-structures under different design scenarios to showcase the effectiveness and versatility of our approach. We also design thermal meta-structures based on architected cellular materials, a special class of FGMs, using their empirical material laws calculated via numerical homogenization.

However, for systems whose dynamics are characterized by a high state dimension, substantial nonlinearities, and stiffness, suitable methods for online nonlinear MPC are lacking. One example of such a system is a vehicle thermal management system (TMS) with integrated thermal energy storage (TES), also referred to as a hybrid TMS. Here, hybrid refers to the ability to achieve cooling through a conventional heat exchanger or via melting of a phase change material, or both. Given increased electrification in vehicle platforms, more stringent performance specifications are being placed on TMS, in turn requiring more advanced control methods. In this paper, we present the design and real-time implementation of a nonlinear model predictive controller with 77 states on an experimental hybrid TMS testbed. We show how, in spite of high-dimension and stiff dynamics, an explicit integration method can be obtained by linearizing the dynamics at each time step within the MPC horizon. This integration method further allows the first-order gradients to be calculated with minimal additional computational cost. Through simulated and experimental results, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed solution method and the benefits of TES for mitigating highly transient heat loads achieved by actively controlling its charging and discharging behavior.

The disparity in molecular masses, ranging across several orders of magnitude, leads to significant challenges in both the evaluation of collision operators and the designing of time-stepping schemes to capture the multi-scale nature of the dynamics. A direct implementation of the spectral method faces prohibitive computational costs as the mass ratio increases due to the need to resolve vastly different thermal velocities. Unlike [I. M. Gamba, S. Jin, and L. Liu, Commun. Math. Sci., 17 (2019), pp. 1257-1289], we propose an alternative approach based on proper truncation of asymptotic expansions of the collision operators, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and works well for small $\varepsilon$. By incorporating the separation of three time scales in the model's relaxation process [P. Degond and B. Lucquin-Desreux, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 6 (1996), pp. 405-436], we design an AP scheme that captures the specific dynamics of the disparate mass model while maintaining computational efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in handling large mass ratios of heavy and light species, as well as capturing the epochal relaxation phenomenon.

However, these methods are insufficient for high-spatial-resolution short-term nowcasting within 6 hours, which is crucial for warning short-duration, mesoscale and small-scale weather events. Geostationary satellite remote sensing provides detailed, high spatio-temporal and all-day observations, which can address the above limitations of existing methods. Therefore, this paper proposed an advanced data-driven thermal infrared cloud images forecasting model, "DaYu." Unlike existing data-driven weather forecasting models, DaYu is specifically designed for geostationary satellite observations, with a temporal resolution of 0.5 hours and a spatial resolution of ${0.05}^\circ$ $\times$ ${0.05}^\circ$. DaYu is based on a large-scale transformer architecture, which enables it to capture fine-grained cloud structures and learn fast-changing spatio-temporal evolution features effectively. Moreover, its attention mechanism design achieves a balance in computational complexity, making it practical for applications. DaYu not only achieves accurate forecasts up to 3 hours with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.9, 6 hours higher than 0.8, and 12 hours higher than 0.7, but also detects short-duration, mesoscale, and small-scale weather events with enhanced detail, effectively addressing the shortcomings of existing methods in providing detailed short-term nowcasting within 6 hours. Furthermore, DaYu has significant potential in short-term climate disaster prevention and mitigation.

While direct numerical simulations could model surface temperatures with high fidelity, they often take a significant amount of computational time, especially for problems where temperature distributions are required to be repeatedly calculated. To this end, deep operator neural network (DeepONet) provides a powerful tool due to its high computational efficiency and generalization ability. In this work, we applied DeepONet to the modelling of asteroid surface temperatures. Results show that the trained network is able to predict temperature with an accuracy of ~1% on average, while the computational cost is five orders of magnitude lower, hence enabling thermal property analysis in a multidimensional parameter space. As a preliminary application, we analyzed the orbital evolution of asteroids through direct N-body simulations embedded with instantaneous Yarkovsky effect inferred by DeepONet-based thermophysical modelling.Taking asteroids (3200) Phaethon and (89433) 2001 WM41 as examples, we show the efficacy and efficiency of our AI-based approach.

TDS is a widely used technique for quantifying key characteristics of hydrogen-material interactions, such as diffusivity and trapping. However, interpreting the output of TDS experiments is non-trivial and requires appropriate post-processing tools. This work introduces the first software tool capable of simulating TDS curves for arbitrary choices of material parameters and hydrogen trap characteristics, using the primary hydrogen diffusion and trapping models (Oriani, McNabb-Foster). Moreover, TDS Simulator contains a specific functionality for loading experimental TDS data and conducting the inverse calibration of a selected transport model, providing automatic estimates of the density and binding energy of each hydrogen trap type in the material. In its first version, TDS Simulator is provided as a MATLAB App, which is made freely available to the community and provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to make use of TDS Simulator straightforward. As reported in the present manuscript, the outputs of TDS Simulator have been extensively validated against literature data. Demonstrations of automatic determination of trap characteristics from experimental data through the optimisation tool are also provided. The present work enables an efficient and straightforward characterisation of hydrogen-material characteristics relevant to multiple applications, from nuclear fusion to the development of hydrogen-compatible materials for the hydrogen economy.

Traditional methods relying on energy functions and heuristic algorithms for sequence design are inefficient and do not meet the demands of the big data era in biomolecules, with their accuracy limited by the energy functions and search algorithms. Existing deep learning methods are constrained by the learning capabilities of the networks, failing to extract effective information from sparse protein structures, which limits the accuracy of protein design. To address these shortcomings, we developed an Efficient attention-based Models for Computational Protein Design using amino acid microenvironment (EMOCPD). It aims to predict the category of each amino acid in a protein by analyzing the three-dimensional atomic environment surrounding the amino acids, and optimize the protein based on the predicted high-probability potential amino acid categories. EMOCPD employs a multi-head attention mechanism to focus on important features in the sparse protein microenvironment and utilizes an inverse residual structure to optimize the network architecture. The proposed EMOCPD achieves over 80% accuracy on the training set and 68.33% and 62.32% accuracy on two independent test sets, respectively, surpassing the best comparative methods by over 10%. In protein design, the thermal stability and protein expression of the predicted mutants from EMOCPD show significant improvements compared to the wild type, effectively validating EMOCPD's potential in designing superior proteins. Furthermore, the predictions of EMOCPD are influenced positively, negatively, or have minimal impact based on the content of the 20 amino acids, categorizing amino acids as positive, negative, or neutral. Research findings indicate that EMOCPD is more suitable for designing proteins with lower contents of negative amino acids.

However, most existing studies focus only on multi-scale, multi-physics systems within a single spatial region, neglecting the case with multiple interconnected sub-regions, such as gas and thermal systems. To address this, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Partitioned Coupled Neural Operator (PCNO) to enhance the simulation performance of such networks. Compared to the existing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), this method designs a joint convolution operator within the Fourier layer, enabling global integration capturing all sub-regions. Additionally, grid alignment layers are introduced outside the Fourier layer to help the joint convolution operator accurately learn the coupling relationship between sub-regions in the frequency domain. Experiments on gas networks demonstrate that the proposed operator not only accurately simulates complex systems but also shows good generalization and low model complexity.

However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.

The proposed approach optimizes the operation and investment costs for new generation units and transmission lines, while also considering the environmental benefits of integrating renewable energy sources (RES) and the impact of electric vehicle (EV) charging on the grid. The inherent uncertainties in demand, EV charging loads, and RES generation are managed using a hybrid stochastic-robust optimization approach. Additionally, the model integrates Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DTLR) to improve the efficiency and resilience of transmission lines. The framework also tackles the uncertainty related to DTLR, incorporating a heuristic linearization technique to reduce model complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed model and techniques is evaluated through simulations conducted on two case studies: the modified IEEE 6-bus system and the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System.

Traditional methods for investigating the urban thermal environment and corresponding human thermal comfort level are often resource intensive, inefficient, and limited in scope. To address these challenges, we (1) introduce a new concept named thermal affordance, which formalizes the integrated inherent capacity of a streetscape to influence human thermal comfort based on its visual and physical features; and (2) an efficient method to evaluate it (visual assessment of thermal affordance -- VATA), which combines street view imagery (SVI), online and in-field surveys, and statistical learning algorithms. VATA extracts five categories of image features from SVI data and establishes 19 visual-perceptual indicators for streetscape visual assessment. Using a multi-task neural network and elastic net regression, we model their chained relationship to predict and comprehend thermal affordance for Singapore. VATA predictions are validated with field-investigated OTC data, providing a cost-effective, scalable, and transferable method to assess the thermal comfort potential of urban streetscape. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility by generating a geospatially explicit mapping of thermal affordance, outlining a model update workflow for long-term urban-scale analysis, and implementing a two-stage prediction and inference approach (IF-VPI-VATA) to guide future streetscape improvements. This framework can inform streetscape design to support sustainable, liveable, and resilient urban environments.

Coal plants currently contribute to more than 60\% of India's electricity generation in 2022. Upgrading and decarbonizing high-emission coal plants became a pressing energy issue. A key technical parameter for coal plants is the operating station heat rate (SHR), which represents the thermal efficiency of a coal plant. Yet, the operating SHR of Indian coal plants varies and is not comprehensively documented. This study extends from several existing databases and creates an SHR dataset for 806 Indian coal plant units using machine learning (ML), presenting the most comprehensive coverage to date. Additionally, it incorporates environmental factors such as water stress risk and coal prices as prediction features to improve accuracy. This dataset, easily downloadable from our visualization platform, could inform energy and environmental policies for India's coal power generation as the country transitions towards its renewable energy targets.

The integration of renewable energy sources is particularly challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their power generation, which is highly variable compared to fossil fuel sources, delaying the availability of clean energy. To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile.

In a system including short-term electricity storage, long-term heat storage, and where electricity and heat networks are connected through a heat pump, it becomes crucial to operate the system on two time scales. Based on real data from a university building, we simulate the operation of such a system over a year, comparing different strategies based on model predictive control (MPC). The first objective of this paper is to determine the minimum prediction horizon to retrieve the results of the full-horizon operation problem with cost minimization. The second objective is to evaluate a method that combines MPC with setting targets on the heat storage level at the end of the prediction horizon, based on historical data. For a prediction horizon of 6 days, the suboptimality gap with the full-horizon results is 4.31%, compared to 11.42% when using a prediction horizon of 42 days and fixing the final level to be equal to the initial level, which is a common approach.

We present a first computational modelling study that describes time-dependent fracture propagation in an idealised glacier causing rapid supraglacial lake drainage. A novel two-scale numerical method is developed to capture the elastic and viscoelastic deformations of ice along with crevasse propagation. The fluid-conserving thermo-hydro-mechanical model incorporates turbulent fluid flow and accounts for melting/refreezing in fractures. Applying this model to observational data from a 2008 rapid lake drainage event indicates that viscous deformation exerts a much stronger control on hydrofracture propagation compared to thermal effects. This finding contradicts the conventional assumption that elastic deformation is adequate to describe fracture propagation in glaciers over short timescales (minutes to several hours) and instead demonstrates that viscous deformation must be considered to reproduce observations of lake drainage rate and local ice surface elevation change. As supraglacial lakes continue expanding inland and as Greenland Ice Sheet temperatures become warmer than -8 degree C, our results suggest rapid lake drainages are likely to occur without refreezing, which has implications for the rate of sea level rise.

The strong temperature dependence of the rheology of mantle rocks causes viscosity variations of several orders of magnitude, leading to a slow-evolving stagnant lid where heat conduction dominates, overlying a rapidly-evolving and strongly convecting region. Time-stepping methods, while effective for fluids with constant viscosity, are hindered by the Courant criterion, which restricts the time step based on the system's maximum velocity and grid size. Consequently, achieving steady-state requires a large number of time steps due to the disparate time scales governing the stagnant and convecting regions.
  We present a concept for accelerating mantle convection simulations using machine learning. We generate a dataset of 128 two-dimensional simulations with mixed basal and internal heating, and pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity. We train a feedforward neural network on 97 simulations to predict steady-state temperature profiles. These can then be used to initialize numerical time stepping methods for different simulation parameters. Compared to typical initializations, the number of time steps required to reach steady-state is reduced by a median factor of 3.75. The benefit of this method lies in requiring very few simulations to train on, providing a solution with no prediction error as we initialize a numerical method, and posing minimal computational overhead at inference time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and discuss the potential implications for accelerated simulations for advancing mantle convection research.

This optimization framework consists of (1) a random profile generation scheme, (2) deep learning (DL) based surrogate models for the prediction of thermal and structural quantities, and (3) a genetic algorithm (GA). From the proposed random profile generation scheme, we strive for a generic design space that does not contain impractical designs, i.e., profiles with sharp gradations. We also show that the power law is a strict subset of the proposed design space. We use a dense neural network-based surrogate model for the prediction of maximum stress, while the deep neural operator DeepONet is used for the prediction of the thermal field. The point-wise effective prediction of the thermal field enables us to implement the constraint that the metallic content of the FGM remains within a specified limit. The integration of the profile generation scheme and DL-based surrogate models with GA provides us with an efficient optimization scheme. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through various numerical examples.

Using tools from perturbation theory, we show that in the limit of low transmitter brightness, high loss, and high thermal background, there is a factor of four improvement in the Chernoff exponent of the error probability in discriminating any number of apriori-known reflective targets when using a Gaussian-state entangled QI probe, over using classical coherent-state illumination (CI). While this advantage was known for detecting the presence or absence of a target, it had not been proven for the generalized task of discriminating between arbitrary target libraries. In proving our result, we derive simple general analytic expressions for the lowest-order asymptotic expansions of the quantum Chernoff exponents for QI and CI in terms of the signal brightness, loss, thermal noise, and the modal expansion coefficients of the target-reflected light's radiant exitance profiles when separated by a spatial mode sorter after entering the entrance pupil of the receiver's aperture.

The physical process is modeled as follows. The absorbed electromagnetic power increases the skin temperature. Wherever it is above a temperature threshold, thermal nociceptors are activated and transduce an electrical signal. When the activated skin volume reaches a threshold, the flight signal is initiated. After the delay of human reaction time, the flight action is materialized when the subject moves away or the beam power is turned off. The injury risk is quantified by the thermal damage parameter calculated in the Arrhenius equation. It depends on the beam power density absorbed into the skin, which is not measurable. In addition, the volume threshold for flight initiation is unknown. To circumference these difficulties, we normalize the formulation and write the thermal damage parameter in terms of the occurrence time of flight action, which is reliably observed in exposure tests. This thermal injury formulation provides a viable framework for investigating the effects of model parameters.

To address these challenges, we developed \textit{Respiratory Differencing}, a novel intraoperative CT image assistance system aimed at improving ablation evaluation. The system first segments tumor regions in preoperative CT images and then employs a multi-stage registration process to align these images with corresponding intraoperative or postoperative images, compensating for respiratory deformations and treatment-induced changes. This system provides two key outputs to help physicians evaluate intraoperative ablation. First, differential images are generated by subtracting the registered preoperative images from the intraoperative ones, allowing direct visualization and quantitative comparison of pre- and post-treatment differences. These differential images enable physicians to assess the relative positions of the tumor and ablation zones, even when the tumor is no longer visible in post-ablation images, thus improving the subjective evaluation of ablation effectiveness. Second, the system provides a quantitative metric that measures the discrepancies between the tumor area and the treatment zone, offering a numerical assessment of the overall efficacy of ablation.This pioneering system compensates for complex lung deformations and integrates pre- and intra-operative imaging data, enhancing quality control in cancer ablation treatments. A follow-up study involving 35 clinical cases demonstrated that our system significantly outperforms traditional subjective assessments in identifying under-ablation cases during or immediately after treatment, highlighting its potential to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

Previous studies have generally attempted to address this issue at either the micro- or macro-level, but each approach presents different limitations in modeling the impacts on transit trips. Other research proposes a meso-level approach to address some of these gaps, but the use of additive exposure calculation and spatial shortest path routing poses constraints meso-modeling accuracy. This study introduces HeatPath Analyzer, a framework to assess the exposure of transit riders to extreme temperatures, using TransitSim 4.0 to generate second-by-second spatio-temporal trip trajectories, the traveler activity profiles, and thermal comfort levels along the entire journey. The approach uses heat stress combines the standards proposed by the NWS and CDC to estimate cumulative exposure for transit riders, with specific parameters tailored to the elderly and people with disabilities. The framework assesses the influence of extreme heat and winter chill. A case study in Atlanta, GA, reveals that 10.2% of trips on an average summer weekday in 2019 were at risk of extreme heat. The results uncover exposure disparities across different transit trip mode segments, and across mitigation-based and adaptation-based strategies. While the mitigation-based strategy highlights high-exposure segments such as long ingress and egress, adaptation should be prioritized toward the middle or second half of the trip when a traveler is waiting for transit or transferring between routes. A comparison between the traditional additive approach and the dynamic approach presented also shows significant disparities, which, if overlooked, can mislead policy decisions.

Just as a swarm of ants collectively moves a large object, similar functions can emerge within a group of robots through individual strategies based on local sensing. However, realizing collective functions with individually controlled microrobots is particularly challenging due to their micrometer size, large number of degrees of freedom, strong thermal noise relative to the propulsion speed, complex physical coupling between neighboring microrobots, and surface collisions. Here, we implement Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to generate a control strategy for up to 200 microrobots whose motions are individually controlled by laser spots. During the learning process, we employ so-called counterfactual rewards that automatically assign credit to the individual microrobots, which allows for fast and unbiased training. With the help of this efficient reward scheme, swarm microrobots learn to collectively transport a large cargo object to an arbitrary position and orientation, similar to ant swarms. We demonstrate that this flexible and versatile swarm robotic system is robust to variations in group size, the presence of malfunctioning units, and environmental noise. Such control strategies can potentially enable complex and automated assembly of mobile micromachines, programmable drug delivery capsules, and other advanced lab-on-a-chip applications.

The impact of various parameters, including Reynolds number ($Re$), Richardson number ($Ri$), Hartmann number ($Ha$), wavy wall peaks ($n$), nanoparticle volume fraction ($Ï$), Hartmann angle ($Î³$), rotational speed ($Ï$), and inclination angle ($Î±$), on thermal and fluid dynamic behaviors is analyzed. MWCNT nanofluids exhibit up to a 19.1% increase in $Nu_{\text{ave}}$ compared to SWCNT nanofluids, confirming their superior heat transfer performance. Adding a second heated cylinder increases $Nu_{\text{ave}}$ by approximately 71.7% compared to a single-cylinder configuration, while the inclusion of a flow deflector modifies vortex structures, further enhancing convective transport. Increasing wavy wall peaks ($n$) enhances heat transfer by intensifying vortex formation and disrupting thermal boundary layers, leading to a more uniform temperature distribution. SWCNT nanofluids exhibit Bejan numbers up to 58.7% higher than MWCNT nanofluids, indicating greater thermal irreversibility. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing thermal management systems in engineering applications, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate nanofluids, geometric configurations, and magnetic field parameters to achieve optimal thermal performance and fluid stability.

By developing and validating Single-Laser GNN (SL-GNN) and Multi-Laser GNN (ML-GNN) surrogates, the research introduces a scalable data-driven approach that learns fundamental physics from small-scale Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations and applies them to larger domains. Achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 3.77% with the baseline SL-GNN model, GNNs effectively learn from high-resolution simulations and generalize well across larger geometries. The proposed models capture the complexity of the heat transfer process in L-PBF while significantly reducing computational costs. For example, a thermomechanical simulation for a 2 mm x 2 mm domain typically requires about 4 hours, whereas the SL-GNN model can predict thermal distributions almost instantly. Calibrating models to larger domains enhances predictive performance, with significant drops in MAPE for 3 mm x 3 mm and 4 mm x 4 mm domains, highlighting the scalability and efficiency of this approach. Additionally, models show a decreasing trend in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) when tuned to larger domains, suggesting potential for becoming geometry-agnostic. The interaction of multiple lasers complicates heat transfer, necessitating larger model architectures and advanced feature engineering. Using hyperparameters from Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization, the best ML-GNN model demonstrates a 46.4% improvement in MAPE over the baseline ML-GNN model. In summary, this approach enables more efficient and flexible predictive modeling in L-PBF additive manufacturing.

In particular, heat pumps offer an effective solution by employing smart control methods that adjust the heat pump's power output in reaction to demand response signals. This paper combines imitation learning based on an artificial neural network with an intelligent control approach for heat pumps. We train the model using the output data of an optimization problem to determine the optimal operation schedule of a heat pump. The objective is to minimize the electricity cost with a time-variable electricity tariff while keeping the building temperature within acceptable boundaries. We evaluate our developed novel method, PSC-ANN, on various multi-family buildings with differing insulation levels that utilize an underfloor heating system as thermal storage. The results show that PSC-ANN outperforms a positively evaluated intelligent control approach from the literature and a conventional control approach. Further, our experiments reveal that a trained imitation learning model for a specific building is also applicable to other similar buildings without the need to train it again with new data. Our developed approach also reduces the execution time compared to optimally solving the corresponding optimization problem. PSC-ANN can be integrated into multiple buildings, enabling them to better utilize renewable energy sources by adjusting their electricity consumption in response to volatile external signals.

The LPBF process uses moving heat sources to melt and solidify metal powders. The fast melting and cooling leads to residual stress, which critically affects the part quality. Currently, the computational intensity of accurately simulating the residual stress on the path scale remains a significant challenge, limiting our understanding of the LPBF processes.
  This paper presents a framework for simulating the LPBF process residual stress based on the path-level thermal history. Compared with the existing approaches, the path-level simulation requires discretization only to capture the scanning path rather than the details of the melt pools, thus requiring less dense mesh and is more computationally efficient. We develop this framework by introducing a new concept termed effective thermal strain to capture the anisotropic thermal strain near and around the melt pool. We validate our approach with the high-fidelity results from the literature. We use the proposed approach to simulate various single-island scanning patterns and layers with multiple full and trimmed islands. We further investigate the influence of the path-level thermal history and the layer shape on the residual stress by analyzing their simulation results.

This study has significant relevance in post-disaster scenarios, including events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, military conflicts, wildfires, and more. These drones are capable of hovering over disaster-stricken areas that may be challenging for rescue teams to access directly. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones, are frequently deployed for search-and-rescue missions during disaster situations. Typically, drones capture aerial images to assess structural damage and identify the extent of the disaster. They also employ thermal imaging technology to detect body heat signatures, which can help locate individuals. In some cases, larger drones are used to deliver essential supplies to people stranded in isolated disaster-stricken areas. In our discussions, we delve into the unique challenges associated with locating humans through aerial acoustics. The auditory system must distinguish between human cries and sounds that occur naturally, such as animal calls and wind. Additionally, it should be capable of recognizing distinct patterns related to signals like shouting, clapping, or other ways in which people attempt to signal rescue teams. To tackle this challenge, one solution involves harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze sound frequencies and identify common audio signatures. Deep learning-based networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be trained using these signatures to filter out noise generated by drone motors and other environmental factors. Furthermore, employing signal processing techniques like the direction of arrival (DOA) based on microphone array signals can enhance the precision of tracking the source of human noises.

We permit heterogeneous material composition: spatially dependent density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. Mathematically, the problem is described by a heat equation with Robin boundary conditions. The crucial parameter is the Biot number -- a nondimensional heat transfer (Robin) coefficient; we consider the limit of small Biot number.
  We introduce first-order and second-order asymptotic approximations (in Biot number) for several quantities of interest, notably the spatial domain average temperature as a function of time; the first-order approximation is simply the standard engineering `lumped' model. We then provide asymptotic error estimates for the first-order and second-order approximations for small Biot number, and also, for the first-order approximation, alternative strict bounds valid for all Biot number. Companion numerical solutions of the heat equation confirm the effectiveness of the error estimates for small Biot number.
  The second-order approximation and the first-order and second-order error estimates depend on several functional outputs associated to an elliptic partial differential equation; the latter is derived from Biot-sensitivity analysis of the heat equation eigenproblem in the limit of small Biot number. Most important is $Ï$, the only functional output required for the first-order error estimates; $Ï$ admits a simple physical interpretation in terms of conduction length scale. We investigate the domain and property dependence of $Ï$: most notably, we characterize spatial domains for which the standard lumped-model error criterion -- Biot number (based on volume-to-area length scale) small -- is deficient.

The large temporal and spatial variations in temperature that can occur in layer-wise AM lead to thermal excursions, resulting in property variations and defects. These variations cannot always be fully mitigated by simple static parameter search. To address this challenge, we propose a general approach based on modeling AM processes on the part-scale in state-space and framing AM process planning as a numerical optimal control problem. We demonstrate this approach on the problem of minimizing thermal variation in a given layer in the electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) AM process, and are able to compute globally optimal dynamic process plans. These optimized process plans are then evaluated in simulation, achieving an 87% and 86% reduction in cumulative variance compared to random spot melting and a uniform power field respectively, and are further validated in experiment. This one-shot feedforward planning approach expands the capabilities of AM technology by minimizing the need for experimentation and iteration to achieve process optimization. Further, this work opens the possibility for the application of optimal control theory to part-scale optimization and control in AM.

Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.

Vapor chambers (VCs), because of their ability to effectively spread heat over a large area by two-phase heat transfer, seem ideal for such applications. However, creating thin and efficient vapor chambers that work over a wide range of power inputs is a persisting challenge. VCs that use wicks for circulating the phase changing media, suffer from capillary restrictions, dry-out, clogging, increase in size and weight, and can often be costly. Recent developments in wick-free wettability patterned vapor chambers replace traditional wicks with laser-fabricated wickless components. An experimental setup allows for fast testing and experimental evaluation of water-charged VCs with liquid-assisted cooling. The sealed chamber can maintain vacuum for long durations, and can be used for testing of very thin wick-free VCs. This work extends our previous study by decreasing overall thickness of the wick-free VC down to 3 mm and evaluates its performance. Furthermore, the impact of wettability patterns on VC performance is investigated, by carrying out experiments both in non-patterned and patterned VCs. Experiments are first carried out on a wick-free VC with no wettability patterns and comprising of an entirely superhydrophilic evaporator coupled with a hydrophobic condenser. Thereafter, wettability patterns that aid the rapid return of water to the heated site on the evaporator and improve condensation on the condenser of the vapor chamber are implemented. The thermal characteristics show that the patterned VCs outperform the non-patterned VCs under all scenarios. The patterned VCs exhibit low thermal resistance independent of fluid charging ratio withstanding higher power inputs without thermal dry-outs.

Traditional vapor chambers use wicks to transport condensate for efficient thermal exchange and to prevent "dry-out" of the evaporator. However, wicks in vapor chambers present significant design challenges arising out of large pressure drops across the wicking material, which slows down condensate transport rates and increases the chances for dry-out. Thicker wicks add to overall thermal resistance, while deterring the development of thinner devices by limiting the total thickness of the vapor chamber. Wickless vapor chambers eliminate the use of metal wicks entirely, by incorporating complementary wettability-patterned flat plates on both the evaporator and the condenser side. Such surface modifications enhance fluid transport on the evaporator side, while allowing the chambers to be virtually as thin as imaginable, thereby permitting design of thermally efficient thin electronic cooling devices. While wick-free vapor chambers have been studied and efficient design strategies have been suggested, we delve into real-life applications of wick-free vapor chambers in forced air cooling of high-power electronics. An experimental setup is developed wherein two Si-based MOSFETs of TO-247-3 packaging having high conduction resistance, are connected in parallel and switched at 100 kHz, to emulate high frequency power electronics operations. A rectangular copper wick-free vapor chamber spreads heat laterally over a surface 13 times larger than the heating area. This chamber is cooled externally by a fan that circulates air at room temperature. The present experimental setup extends our previous work on wick-free vapor chambers, while demonstrating the effectiveness of low-cost air cooling in vapor-chamber enhanced high-power electronics applications.

Utilizing room-level time-series data from 1,000 houses, metadata from 110,000 houses across the United States, and data from two real-world testbeds, we examine the limitations of SZMNSs and explore the potential of remote sensors. We discovered that comfortable DR durations (CDRDs) for rooms are typically 70% longer or 40% shorter than for the room with the thermostat. When averaging, rooms at the control temperature's bounds are typically deviated around -3Â°F to 2.5Â°F from the average. Moreover, in 95% of houses, we identified rooms experiencing notably higher solar gains compared to the rest of the rooms, while 85% and 70% of houses demonstrated lower heat input and poor insulation, respectively. Lastly, it became evident that the consumption of cooling energy escalates with the increase in the number of sensors, whereas heating usage experiences fluctuations ranging from -19% to +25%. This study serves as a benchmark for assessing the thermal comfort and DR services in the existing housing stock, while also highlighting the energy efficiency impacts of sensing technologies. Our approach sets the stage for more granular, precise control strategies of SZMNSs.

Furthermore, we propose a new approach to update porosity solely determined by the strain change rather than damage evolution as in the existing models. As such, these poroelastic behaviors of Biot's coefficient and the porosity dictate Biot's modulus and the thermal expansion coefficient. For numerical implementation, we employ an isotropic diffusion method to stabilize the advection-dominated heat flux and adapt the fixed stress split method to account for the thermal stress. We verify our model against a series of analytical solutions such as Terzaghi's consolidation, thermal consolidation, and the plane strain hydraulic fracture propagation, known as the KGD fracture. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the stabilization method and intricate thermo-hydro-mechanical interactions during hydraulic fracturing with and without a pre-existing weak interface.

It tackles the convection-diffusion heat transfer equation by integrating an instantaneous point heat source across the volume of the ellipsoidal shape. The model's precision is validated by the excellent match between the predicted transient temperatures and empirical data from bead-on-plate specimens, enhancing its capability to accurately predict in-process temperature profiles in laser-based metal additive manufacturing (AM) operations. Developed in Python, the model offers customized calculations from setup to boundary conditions, adapting to variations in material properties under intense heat gradients. It considers the temperature dependency of thermal material properties and AM-process parameters, accounting for significant temperature gradients and changes in heat transfer mechanisms. The model also includes phase changes of melting or solidification with adjusted heat capacity to accurately reflect these transformations. Additionally, it considers the effects of variable laser power, scanning speed, and timing across each scanning pattern segment, acknowledging the thermal interactions between successive layers and their impact on heat transfer. This comprehensive analytical model is ready for applications including thermal stress analysis, microstructure modeling, and simulation of AM processes, predicting residual stresses and distortions.

However, the accumulation of internal residual stress during printing can cause significant distortion and potential failure. Although various scan patterns have been studied to reduce possible accumulated stress, such as zigzag scanning vectors with changing directions or a chessboard-based scan pattern with divided small islands, most conventional scan patterns cannot significantly reduce residual stress. The proposed adaptive toolpath generation (ATG) algorithms, aiming to minimize the thermal gradients, may result in extremely accumulated temperature fields in some cases. To address these issues, we developed a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based toolpath generation framework, with the goal of achieving uniformly distributed heat and avoiding extremely thermal accumulation regions during the LPBF process. We first developed an overall pipeline for the DRL-based toolpath generation framework, which includes uniformly sampling, agent moving and environment observation, action selection, moving constraints, rewards calculation, and the training process. To accelerate the training process, we simplified the data-intensive numerical model by considering the turning angles on the toolpath. We designed the action spaces with three options, including the minimum temperature value, the smoothest path, and the second smoothest path. The reward function was designed to minimize energy density to ensure the temperature field remains relatively stable. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based toolpath generation framework, we performed numerical simulations of polygon shape printing domains. In addition, four groups of thin plate samples with different scan patterns were compared using the LPBF process.

With the presence of thermal fluctuation, the non-destructive SOT-driven magnetization switching characteristics lead to a random weight matrix with controllable probability distribution. In the meanwhile, the proposed CIM architecture allows for the concurrent execution of the probabilistic vector-matrix multiplication (PVMM) and binarization. Furthermore, leveraging the effectiveness of random binary cells to propagate multi-bit probabilistic information, our SOT-MRAM-based PBNN system achieves a 97.78\% classification accuracy under a 7.01\% weight variation on the MNIST database through 10 sampling cycles, and the number of bit-level computation operations is reduced by a factor of 6.9 compared to that of the full-precision LeNet-5 network.

However, their runtime requirements have prevented them from being broadly deployed on mobile. As personal devices become increasingly powerful and prompt privacy becomes an ever more pressing issue, we explore the current state of mobile execution of Large Language Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we have created our own automation infrastructure, MELT, which supports the headless execution and benchmarking of LLMs on device, supporting different models, devices and frameworks, including Android, iOS and Nvidia Jetson devices. We evaluate popular instruction fine-tuned LLMs and leverage different frameworks to measure their end-to-end and granular performance, tracing their memory and energy requirements along the way. Our analysis is the first systematic study of on-device LLM execution, quantifying performance, energy efficiency and accuracy across various state-of-the-art models and showcases the state of on-device intelligence in the era of hyperscale models. Results highlight the performance heterogeneity across targets and corroborates that LLM inference is largely memory-bound. Quantization drastically reduces memory requirements and renders execution viable, but at a non-negligible accuracy cost. Drawing from its energy footprint and thermal behavior, the continuous execution of LLMs remains elusive, as both factors negatively affect user experience. Last, our experience shows that the ecosystem is still in its infancy, and algorithmic as well as hardware breakthroughs can significantly shift the execution cost. We expect NPU acceleration, and framework-hardware co-design to be the biggest bet towards efficient standalone execution, with the alternative of offloading tailored towards edge deployments.

Computing the TPF, i.e., determining the grid state consisting of temperatures, pressures, and mass flows for given supply and demand values, is classically done by solving the nonlinear heat grid equations, but can be sped up by orders of magnitude using learned models such as neural networks. We propose a novel, efficient scheme to generate a sufficiently large training data set covering relevant supply and demand values. Instead of sampling supply and demand values, our approach generates training examples from a proxy distribution over generator and consumer mass flows, omitting the iterations needed for solving the heat grid equations. The exact, but slightly different, training examples can be weighted to represent the original training distribution. We show with simulations for typical grid structures that the new approach can reduce training set generation times by two orders of magnitude compared to sampling supply and demand values directly, without loss of relevance for the training samples. Moreover, learning TPF with a training data set is shown to outperform sample-free, physics-aware training approaches significantly.

Traditional design processes, which rely heavily on iterative optimization and extensive guesswork, are notoriously slow and inefficient, often leading to suboptimal solutions. In contrast, our innovative method uses a parametric denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with classifier and cooling guidance to generate optimized cell layouts with enhanced cooling paths, significantly lowering the maximum temperature of the cells. By incorporating position-based classifier guidance, we ensure the feasibility of generated layouts. Meanwhile, cooling guidance directly optimizes cooling-efficiency, making our approach uniquely effective. When compared to two advanced models, the Tabular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (TabDDPM) and the Conditional Tabular GAN (CTGAN), our cooling-guided diffusion model notably outperforms both. It is five times more effective than TabDDPM and sixty-six times better than CTGAN across key metrics such as feasibility, diversity, and cooling efficiency. This research marks a significant leap forward in the field, aiming to optimize battery cell layouts for superior cooling efficiency, thus setting the stage for the development of more effective and dependable battery thermal management systems.

To achieve optimal domain interpretation with limited resources, we propose CSDNet, a lightweight \textbf{C}ross \textbf{S}hallow and \textbf{D}eep Perception \textbf{Net}work designed to integrate two modalities with less coherence, thereby discarding redundant information or even modality. We implement our CSDNet for Salient Object Detection (SOD) task in robotic perception. The proposed method capitalises on spatial information prescreening and implicit coherence navigation across shallow and deep layers of the depth-thermal (D-T) modality, prioritising integration over fusion to maximise the scene interpretation. To further refine the descriptive capabilities of the encoder for the less-known D-T modalities, we also propose SAMAEP to guide an effective feature mapping to the generalised feature space. Our approach is tested on the VDT-2048 dataset, leveraging the D-T modality outperforms those of SOTA methods using RGB-T or RGB-D modalities for the first time, achieves comparable performance with the RGB-D-T triple-modality benchmark method with 5.97 times faster at runtime and demanding 0.0036 times fewer FLOPs.

An original codebase called CHAD (Coupled Hydrodynamics and Anaerobic Digestion) is extended to incorporate turbulent diffusion and validate it against results from OpenFOAM with 2D Rayleigh-Taylor Instability and lid-driven cavity simulations. The models are then tested for the applications with Anaerobic Digestion - a widely used wastewater treatment method. The findings demonstrate that the implemented models accurately capture turbulent diffusion when provided with an accurate flow field. Specifically, a minor effect of chemical turbulent diffusion on biochemical reactions within the anaerobic digestion tank is observed, while thermal turbulent diffusion significantly influences mixing. By successfully implementing turbulent diffusion models in CHAD, its capabilities for more accurate anaerobic digestion simulations are enhanced, aiding in optimizing the design and operation of anaerobic digestion reactors in real-world wastewater treatment applications.

The scalability and the potential to compute beyond the von Neumann model make VO2 especially appealing for implementation in oscillating neural networks for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, to solve constraint satisfaction problems, and for pattern recognition. Its integration into large networks of oscillators on a Silicon platform still poses challenges associated with the stabilization in the correct oxidation state and the ability to fabricate a structure with predictable electrical behavior showing very low variability. In this work, the role played by the different annealing parameters applied by three methods (slow thermal annealing, flash annealing, and rapid thermal annealing), following the vanadium oxide atomic layer deposition (ALD), on the formation of VO2 grains is studied and an optimal substrate stack configuration that minimizes variability between devices is proposed. Material and electrical characterizations are performed on the different films and a step-by-step recipe to build reproducible VO2-based oscillators is presented, which is argued to be made possible thanks to the introduction of a hafnium oxide (HfO2) layer between the silicon substrate and the vanadium oxide layer. Up to seven nearly identical VO2-based devices are contacted simultaneously to create a network of oscillators, paving the way for large-scale implementation of VO2 oscillating neural networks.

The neck includes a BI-FPN block combined with the use of a sliding window and a transformer to increase the information fed into the prediction head. The prediction head carries out the detection by evaluating feature maps with the Sigmoid function. The use of transformers with attention and sliding windows increases recognition accuracy while keeping the model at a reasonable number of parameters and computation requirements for embedded systems.

Quantum repeaters based on GKP-encoded light have been shown to support high end-to-end entanglement rates across large distances despite realistic finite squeezing in GKP code preparation and homodyne detection inefficiencies. Here, we introduce a quantum switch for GKP-qubit-based quantum networks, whose architecture involves multiplexed GKP-qubit-based entanglement link generation with clients, and their all-photonic storage, together enabled by GKP-qubit graph state resources. For bipartite entanglement distribution between clients via entanglement swapping, the switch uses a multi-client generalization of a recently introduced $\textit{entanglement-ranking-based link matching}$ protocol heuristic. Since generating the GKP-qubit graph state resource is hardware intensive, given a total resource budget and an arbitrary layout of clients, we address the question of their optimal allocation towards the different client-pair connections served by the switch such that the sum throughput of the switch is maximized while also being fair in terms of the individual entanglement rates. We illustrate our results for an exemplary data center network, where the data center is a client of a switch and all of its other clients aim to connect to the data center alone -- a scenario that also captures the general case of a gateway router connecting a local area network to a global network. Together with compatible quantum repeaters, our quantum switch provides a way to realize quantum networks of arbitrary topology.

Firstly, it introduces a methodology of optimizing aggregated flexibility provision strategies in environments with limited data, utilizing Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and clustering techniques to identify building occupants' activity patterns. Secondly, the study assesses the disaggregated flexibility provision of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems during DR events, employing machine learning and optimization techniques for precise, device-level analysis. The first approach offers a non-intrusive pathway for aggregators to provide flexibility services in environments of a single smart meter for the whole building's consumption, while the second approach maximizes the amount of flexibility in the case of dedicated metering devices to the HVAC systems by carefully considering building occupants' thermal comfort profiles. Through the application of data-driven techniques and encompassing case studies from both industrial and residential buildings, this paper not only unveils pivotal opportunities for aggregators in the balancing and emerging flexibility markets but also successfully develops and demonstrates end-to-end practical tools for aggregators.

Compared to the use of standard RGB cameras, the proposed system is insensitive to lighting variations while being significantly less expensive compared to high-frequency radars, time-of-flight cameras and high-resolution thermal sensors previously used in literature. Crucially, this paper shows that the innovative use of the recently proposed Monostable Multivibrator (MMV) neural networks as a new class of SNN achieves more than one order of magnitude smaller memory and compute complexity compared to deep learning approaches, while reaching a top gesture recognition accuracy of 93.9% using a 5-class thermal camera dataset acquired in a car cabin, within an automotive context. Our dataset is released for helping future research.

The model was implemented into the open-source simulation framework, waLBerla, and extended to conduct the collision stage using central moments. The multiphase model was coupled with both a passive-scalar thermal LB, and a RK solution to the energy equation in order to resolve temperature-dependent surface tension phenomena. Various lattice stencils (D3Q7, D3Q15, D3Q19, D3Q27) were tested for the passive-scalar LB and both the second- and fourth-order RK methods were investigated. There was no significant difference observed in the accuracy of the LB or RK schemes. The passive scalar D3Q7 LB discretisation tended to provide computational benefits, while the second order RK scheme is superior in memory usage. This paper makes contributions relating to the modelling of thermocapillary flows and to understanding the behaviour of droplet capture with thermal sources analogous to thermal tweezers. Four primary contributions to the literature are identified. First, a new 3D thermocapillary, central-moment phase-field LB model is presented and implemented in the open-source software, waLBerla. Second, the accuracy and computational performance of various techniques to resolve the energy equation for multiphase, incompressible fluids is investigated. Third, the dynamic droplet transport behaviour in the presence of thermal sources is studied and insight is provided on the potential ability to manipulate droplets based on local domain heating. Finally, a concise analysis of the computational performance together with near-perfect scaling results on NVIDIA and AMD GPU-clusters is shown. This research enables the detailed study of droplet manipulation and control in thermocapillary devices.

The development of dispatch planning tools is mandatory to account for uncertainties associated with solar irradiation and electricity price forecasts as well as limited storage capacity. This study proposes the Stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Program (SMILP) to maximize expected profit within a specified scenario space. The SMILP scenario space is generated by different Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function percentiles of the potential solar energy to accumulate in storage and the expected profit is estimated using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. SMILP exhibits robust performance, however, its computational time poses a challenge. Thus, three heuristic solutions are developed which run a set of deterministic optimizations on different historical weather profiles to generate candidate dispatching plans (DPs). The candidate DP with the best average performance on all profiles is then selected. The new methods were applied to a case study for a 115 MW CST plant in South Australia. When the historical database has a limited set of historical weather profiles, the SMILP achieves 6% to 9% higher profit than the closest benchmark when the DP is applied to novel weather conditions. With a large historical weather data, the performance of SMILP and Heuristic-2 becomes nearly identical because the SMILP can only utilize a limited number of trajectories for optimization without becoming computationally infeasible. In this case, Heuristic-2 emerges a practical alternative, since it provides similar average profit in a reasonable time (saving about 7 hours in computing time).

However, increasing penetration of renewable energy resources will also pose higher requirements on system flexibility. Allowing renewable themselves to participate in the reserve market could be a viable solution. To this end, this paper proposes an optimal dispatch model for joint energy-reserve procurement that incorporates renewable portfolio standards and RES serve as reserve providers. Potential generator outages and deviations in renewable and load power are modelled through a given number of probability-weighted scenarios. In particular, reserve resources are initially booked in the base case and then activated in non-base scenarios through the re-dispatch process. Marginal pricing is used to derive energy, reserve, and power deviation prices. Next, we develop the associated settlement process and establish several market properties. The proposed pricing scheme establishes equivalence between thermal generators and renewable units by accounting for their uncertainties, including thermal generator outages and renewable power deviations, and their flexibility, namely reserve and re-dispatch. We have shown that for renewable resources, supplying reserve according to the dispatch results compared to generating as much as possible leads to better profits. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and properties established.

However, urban trees are often affected by abiotic and biotic stressors that hamper their functionality, and whenever not timely managed, even their survival. While the current greenery inspection techniques can help in taking effective measures, they often require a high amount of human labor, making frequent assessments infeasible at city-wide scales. In this paper, we present GreenScan, a ground-based sensing system designed to provide health assessments of urban trees at high spatio-temporal resolutions, with low costs. The system utilises thermal and multi-spectral imaging sensors fused using a custom computer vision model in order to estimate two tree health indexes. The evaluation of the system was performed through data collection experiments in Cambridge, USA. Overall, this work illustrates a novel approach for autonomous mobile ground-based tree health monitoring on city-wide scales at high temporal resolutions with low-costs.

In this study, we introduce an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework that integrates the strengths of machine learning (ML) and graphics processing unit (GPU) to demonstrate their combined capability. Within this framework, all computational operations are solely executed on GPU, including ML-accelerated chemistry integration, fully-implicit solving of PDEs, and computation of thermal and transport properties, thereby eliminating the CPU-GPU memory copy overhead. Optimisations both within the kernel functions and during the kernel launch process are conducted to enhance computational performance. Strategies such as static data reorganisation and dynamic data allocation are adopted to reduce the GPU memory footprint. The computational performance is evaluated in two turbulent flame benchmarks using quasi-DNS and LES modelling, respectively. Remarkably, while maintaining a similar level of accuracy to the conventional CPU/CVODE-based solver, the GPU/ML-accelerated approach shows an overall speedup of over two orders of magnitude for both cases. This result highlights that high-fidelity turbulent combustion simulation with finite-rate chemistry that requires normally hundreds of CPUs can now be performed on portable devices such as laptops with a medium-end GPU.

Employing You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT DETR) models, our project focuses on enhancing early identification of liquid leaks in key infrastructure components such as pipelines, pumps, and tanks. Through the integration of surveillance thermal cameras and sensors, the combined YOLO and RT DETR models demonstrate remarkable efficacy in the continuous monitoring and analysis of visual data within oil and gas facilities. YOLO's real-time object detection capabilities swiftly recognize leaks and their patterns, while RT DETR excels in discerning specific leak-related features, particularly in thermal images. This approach significantly improves the accuracy and speed of leak detection, ultimately mitigating environmental and financial risks associated with liquid leaks.

Various swarm control methods and algorithms are currently known, such as virtual leader, vector and potential field, and others. Such methods often show good results in specific conditions and tasks. The variety of tasks solved by the swarm requires the development of a universal control algorithm. In this paper, we propose an evolution of a thermal motion equivalent method (TMEM) inspired by the behavioural similarity of thermodynamic interactions between molecules. Previous research has shown the high efficiency of such a method for terrain monitoring tasks. This work addresses the problem of swarm formation of geometric structures, as required for logistics and formation movement tasks. It is shown that the formation of swarm geometric structures using the TMEM is possible with a special nonlinear interaction function of the agents. A piecewise linear interaction function is proposed that allows the formation of a stable group of agents. The results of the paper are validated by numerical modelling of the swarm dynamics. A linear quadrocopter model is considered as an agent. The fairness of the choice of the interaction function is shown.

One of the most important thermodynamic features of real-world computers is that they operate very far from thermal equilibrium, in finite time, with many quickly (co-)evolving degrees of freedom. Such computers also must almost always obey multiple physical constraints on how they work. For example, all modern digital computers are periodic processes, governed by a global clock. Another example is that many computers are modular, hierarchical systems, with strong restrictions on the connectivity of their subsystems. This properties hold both for naturally occurring computers, like brains or Eukaryotic cells, as well as digital systems. These features of real-world computers are absent in 20th century analyses of the thermodynamics of computational processes, which focused on quasi-statically slow processes. However, the field of stochastic thermodynamics has been developed in the last few decades - and it provides the formal tools for analyzing systems that have exactly these features of real-world computers. We argue here that these tools, together with other tools currently being developed in stochastic thermodynamics, may help us understand at a far deeper level just how the fundamental physical properties of dynamic systems are related to the computation that they perform.

Conditions for the reproducible formation of such microstructures have been identified in terms of laser-irradiation and film parameters after systematic studies involving a relevant parameter space. The cracks and voids morphology of the sputtered films was rendered undesirable and hence, smoother Ni thin film of same thickness (200nm) were deposited by vacuum evaporation. The continuous nature of the film resulted in radially symmetric thermal expansion and deformation, thus achieving a high yield of microstructures. An improvement in the inductance and the quality factor of on-chip spiral inductors incorporating such laser-microstructured ferromagnetic nickel thin films was observed, which demonstrates the potential of such a laser-based method for fabrication or fine tuning of various micro-/nanoelectric/electronic sensor and other components and systems.

Applying this technology to on-orbit servicing, especially during the capture and containment stages of active space debris removal missions, might offer a secure, adaptable, and cost-effective solution compared to the trend of increasing the degrees of freedom and complexity of the manipulator (e.g. ClearSpace, Astroscale). This work aims to conduct an experimental proof of concept, for which challenges such as radiation, vacuum, and microgravity are significant, but the predominant issue is ensuring effective operation in the extreme temperature swings, where flexible materials may exhibit cryogenic crystallization or drastic shifts in their elasticity. This work addresses this challenge through an initial stage of analytical modeling of the thermal dynamics inside the manipulator in orbit; which is then used for the development of a first experimental prototype tested with liquid nitrogen and heat guns. The multi-layered design for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) leverages the properties of TPU at low infill rates for lightweight inherent flexibility, silicone rubber ensuring structural integrity, PTFE (Teflon) for unparalleled thermal stability, and aerogel for insulation. The tendon-actuated servo-driven gripper is tested in the laboratory by varying the shape and size of objects during the grasping. The results, based on servomotor force metrics to assess the flexible manipulator's adaptability and object capture efficiency across temperature changes, affirm the concept's viability. Forces increase up to 220$\%$ in cryogenic conditions and decrease by no more than 50$\%$ at high temperatures.

Additionally, the issue of an incomplete hydrogen energy chain is widely overlooked in planning models, which hinders the complete analysis of the role of hydrogen in energy systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a high-resolution collaborative planning model for electricity-thermal-hydrogen-coupled energy systems considering both the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of renewable energy resources and the multi-scale bottom-to-top investment strategy for the complete hydrogen energy chain. Considering the high-resolution system operation flexibility, this paper proposes a hydrogen chain-based fast clustering optimization method that can handle high-dimensional data and multi-time scale operation characteristics. The model optimizes the geographical distribution and capacity configuration of the Northeast China energy system in 2050, with hourly operational characteristics. The planning optimization covered single-energy devices, multi-energy-coupled conversion devices, and electric-hydrogen transmission networks. Last but not least, this paper thoroughly examines the optimal portfolio selection of different hydrogen technologies based on the differences in cost, flexibility, and efficiency. In the Pareto analysis, the proposed model reduces CO2 emissions by 60% with a competitive cost. This paper provides a zero-carbon pathway for multi-energy systems with a cost 4% less than the social cost of carbon $44.6/ton, and the integration of the complete hydrogen energy chain reduces the renewable energy curtailment by 97.0%. Besides, the portfolio selection results indicate that the system favors the SOEC with the highest energy efficiency and the PEMFC with the fastest dynamic response when achieving zero-carbon emissions

The resulting impacts on power systems, including reduced capacity and the potential for power outages, underscore the need for accurate assessment methods to ensure the reliable operation of the nation's energy infrastructure. A critical step is to evaluate the usable capacity of a regional power system's generation fleet, which is a complex undertaking and requires precise modeling of the effects of hydrological and meteorological conditions on diverse generating technologies. This paper proposes a systematic, analytical approach for assessing the impacts of extreme summer drought events on the available capacity of hydro, thermal, and renewable energy generators. More specifically, the systematic framework provides plant-level capacity derating models for hydroelectric, once-through cooling thermoelectric, recirculating cooling thermoelectric, combustion turbine, solar PV, and wind turbine systems. Application of the proposed impact assessment framework to the 2025 generation fleet of the real-world power system in the PJM and SERC regions yields insightful results. By examining the daily usable capacity of 6,055 at-risk generators throughout the study region, we find that in the event of the recurrence of the 2007 southeastern summer drought in the near future, the usable capacity of all at-risk power plants may experience a substantial decrease compared to a typical summer, falling within the range of 71% to 81%. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the usable capacity would experience a more pronounced decline under more severe drought conditions. The findings of this study offer valuable insights, enabling stakeholders to enhance the resilience of power systems against the potential effects of extreme drought in the future.

A linear model is developed to simulate the discharge behaviour and examine the thermal behaviour. In particular, a commercial-grade battery is discharged with the industry-standard hybrid power pulsing characterization (HPPC) test and the current and voltage responses are recorded. The dynamic system is modelled with the equivalent circuit model (ECM) through MATLAB Simulink. A block diagram representation of the equivalent circuit model governing equations was developed. The parameter estimation tool was utilized to reduce the error and fit the simulation results to the experimental voltage responses, in order to obtain state of charge dependent dynamic parameters. Those parameters were then used in a Dual-Potential Multi-Scale Multi-Domain (MSMD) Battery Model solved in ANSYS Fluent to analyze the thermal behaviour by acquiring the temperature profiles and the temperature distribution within the cell. The nonlinear behaviour of the battery was characterized and the equivalent circuit model parameters were identified and are shown to agree with the experimental voltage responses. Furthermore, it is found that the battery temperature increased by 7.35 deg and was distributed uniformly within the cell.

Calorimetric methods have surpassed classical electrical methods for the estimation of semiconductor power losses but have mechanical limitations and resort to analytical electrothermal equivalent circuits for this task. These electrothermal models are highly dependent on the topology and technology used on the power converter leading to either simplifications that underestimate the thermal effects or intractable sets of differential equations. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel data-driven identification method to characterize the thermal dynamics of power converters allowing the designer to obtain semiconductor total power losses only by means of temperature measurements without the need of a calorimeter. Given a set of power vs.temperature profiles, our solution identifies the linear model that best fits the data. The solution is based on an optimization problem that allows not only accurate identification but also coding of the desired modeling requirements, such as dynamics' invertibility to allow the estimation of power losses from the temperature profiles. The proposed methodology can be applied to any power converter topology. Furthermore, by obtaining a linear model, standard control theory techniques can be exploited to analyze and control the thermal dynamics. Real experiments validate the generality and accuracy of the proposal.

However, there are several technical and economic barriers that prevent large-scale adoption and integration of energy storage in buildings. These barriers include integration with building control systems, high capital costs, and the necessity to identify and quantify value streams for different stakeholders. To overcome these obstacles, it is crucial to develop advanced sizing and dispatch methods to assist planning and operational decision-making for integrating energy storage in buildings. This work develops a simple and flexible optimal sizing and dispatch framework for thermal energy storage (TES) and battery energy storage (BES) systems in large-scale office buildings. The optimal sizes of TES, BES, as well as other building assets are determined in a joint manner instead of sequentially to avoid sub-optimal solutions. The solution is determined considering both capital costs in optimal sizing and operational benefits in optimal dispatch. With the optimally sized systems, we implemented real-time operation using the model-based control (MPC), facilitating the effective and efficient management of energy resources. Comprehensive assessments are performed using simulation studies to quantify potential energy and economic benefits by different utility tariffs and climate locations, to improve our understanding of the techno-economic performance of different TES and BES systems, and to identify barriers to adopting energy storage for buildings. Finally, the proposed framework will provide guidance to a broad range of stakeholders to properly design energy storage in buildings and maximize potential benefits, thereby advancing affordable building energy storage deployment and helping accelerate the transition towards a cleaner and more equitable energy economy.

Recent advances in remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS or ``drones'') and thermal imaging technology have created new approaches to collect wildlife data. These emerging technologies could provide promising alternatives to standard labourious field techniques as well as cover much larger areas. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review and empirical study of drone-based wildlife detection. Specifically, we collect a realistic dataset of drone-derived wildlife thermal detections. Wildlife detections, including arboreal (for instance, koalas, phascolarctos cinereus) and ground dwelling species in our collected data are annotated via bounding boxes by experts. We then benchmark state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on our collected dataset. We use these experimental results to identify issues and discuss future directions in automatic animal monitoring using drones.

A straightforward application of model predictive control (MPC) requires solving a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) because of the on/off of chillers and the complexity of the DCEP model. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an attractive alternative since its real-time control computation is much simpler. But designing an RL controller is challenging due to myriad design choices and computationally intensive training.
  In this paper, we propose an RL controller and an MPC controller for minimizing the electricity cost of a DCEP, and compare them via simulations. The two controllers are designed to be comparable in terms of objective and information requirements. The RL controller uses a novel Q-learning algorithm that is based on least-squares policy iteration. We describe the design choices for the RL controller, including the choice of state space and basis functions, that are found to be effective. The proposed MPC controller does not need a mixed integer solver for implementation, but only a nonlinear program (NLP) solver. A rule-based baseline controller is also proposed to aid in comparison. Simulation results show that the proposed RL and MPC controllers achieve similar savings over the baseline controller, about 17%.

Despite their reliability and efficiency, power losses in these systems generate significant heat that must be dissipated to maintain performance and prevent damage. Cooling systems play a crucial role in ensuring safe operating temperatures for system components. Air and liquid cooling are the leading technologies used in the power electronics world. Air cooling is simple and cost-effective but is limited by ambient temperature and component thermal resistance. While more efficient, liquid cooling requires more maintenance and has higher upfront costs. Water-cooling systems have become famous for regulating thermal loads as they can effectively remove heat from localized high-temperature areas, such as the challenging hotspots in power electronics systems. In addition to designing a cooling system for a power electronic system, this study investigated the impact of three major parameters; cold plate material, channel shape/size, and coolant inlet velocity. The research examined and analyzed these factors and their trade-off analysis to obtain cooling system design and optimization insights. This study might improve power electronics system performance, reliability, and durability by improving heat dissipation and thermal management.

The ability to fuse these two sensor modalities can potentially reduce the cognitive load on human operators and/or improve the effectiveness of computer vision object detection models. However, the fusion task is particularly challenging in the context of WiSAR due to hardware limitations and extreme environmental factors. This work presents Misaligned Image Synthesis and Fusion using Information from Thermal and Visual (MISFIT-V), a novel two-pronged unsupervised deep learning approach that utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and a cross-attention mechanism to capture the most relevant features from each modality. Experimental results show MISFIT-V offers enhanced robustness against misalignment and poor lighting/thermal environmental conditions compared to existing visual-thermal image fusion methods.

Their criticality arises from their corresponding threat model: By, e.g., passively measuring an integrated circuit's (IC's) environment during a security-related operation, internal secrets may be disclosed. Furthermore, by actively disturbing the physical runtime environment of an IC, an adversary can cause a specific, exploitable misbehavior. The set of physical attacks consists of techniques that apply either globally or locally. When compared to global techniques, local techniques exhibit a much higher precision, hence having the potential to be used in advanced attack scenarios. However, using physical techniques with additional spatial dependency expands the parameter search space exponentially. In this work, we present and compare two techniques, namely laser logic state imaging (LLSI) and lock-in thermography (LIT), that can be used to discover sub-circuitry of an entirely unknown IC based on optical and thermal principles. We show that the time required to identify specific regions can be drastically reduced, thus lowering the complexity of physical attacks requiring positional information. Our case study on an Intel H610 Platform Controller Hub showcases that, depending on the targeted voltage rail, our technique reduces the search space by around 90 to 98 percent.

The creation of infrastructures for smart grids, the efficient utilization of the distributed network's components, and the appropriate administration of the distributed network would result in a valuable solution for the operators of the distributed network. As a result, a framework for peak-load management is given in this research. Within this framework, the real-time rating of the components and the voltage-dependent characteristics of the electric loads work together to assist the DN operator in effectively navigating peak periods. The combination of the conservation voltage reduction (CVR) and the dynamic thermal rating (DTR) of the components that make up the DN produces outcomes that are more helpful than any of these factors alone could provide. This is true even though each of these factors contributes to the efficient functioning of the DN. According to the findings, as compared to the individual implementation of CVR, the simultaneous utilization of DTR and CVR results in a cost-savings rise at peak events which is 58.75 percentage points more than the individual implementation. In addition, a discussion is offered concerning the current difficulties that are being experienced by the feeders that are providing the voltage-dependent constant-power loads during the utilization of the CVR, which are handled by the dynamic rating of the components that make up the DN.

However, emerging energy storage technologies need improvement to compete with lithium-ion batteries and reduce the cost of energy. Identifying and optimizing the the most valuable improvement path of these technologies is challenging due to the non-linearity of the energy system model when considering parameters as independent variables. To overcome this, a novel investment-based optimization method is proposed. The method involves linear optimization of the hybrid renewable energy system and subsequent investment optimization, accounting for diminishing improvements per investment. Applied to thermal energy, pumped thermal energy, molten salt, and adiabatic compressed air energy storage technologies, the results show that enhancing discharge efficiency is most valuable for all technologies. Reducing discharge capacity costs and energy storage capacity cost can also become important. Charge capacity cost and charge efficiency are found to be of lesser significance. The study provides detailed improvement pathways for each technology under various operational conditions, assisting developers in resource allocation. Overall, the investment-based optimization method and findings contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of emerging energy storage technologies and reducing reliance on batteries in renewable energy systems.

The incorporation of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) capsules into Polyurethane (PU) has been shown to be effective in building envelopes. This design can significantly increase the stability of the indoor thermal environment and reduce the fluctuation of indoor air temperature. We develop a multiscale model of a PU-PCM foam composite and study the thermal conductivity of this material. Later, the design of materials can be optimized by obtaining thermal conductivity. We conduct a case study based on the performance of this optimized material to fully consider the thermal comfort of the occupants of a building envelope with the application of PU-PCMs composites in a single room. At the same time, we also predict the energy consumption of this case. All the outcomes show that this design is promising, enabling the passive design of building energy and significantly improving occupants' comfort.

However, data centers also have other operational costs such as the cost of equipment maintenance and replacement. It has been shown that server reliability depends on frequency of their temperature variations, arising from workload transitions due to dynamic demands. In this work, we formulate a nonlinear optimization problem that considers the cost of workload transitions in addition to IT and cooling power consumption. To approximate the solution, we first linearize the problem; the result is a mixed integer programming problem. A modified heuristic is then proposed to approximate the solution of the linear problem. Finally, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is integrated with the proposed heuristics for automatic workload reconfiguration when future demand is not known exactly, but predictions are available. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes are attractive in different settings.

Remote object material and temperature determine the spectrum of thermal radiance, and range, air temperature, and gas concentrations determine how this spectrum is modified by propagation to the sensor. We introduce a passive range imaging method based on computationally separating these phenomena. Previous methods assume hot and highly emitting objects; ranging is more challenging when objects' temperatures do not deviate greatly from air temperature. Our method jointly estimates range and intrinsic object properties, with explicit consideration of air emission, though reflected light is assumed negligible. Inversion being underdetermined is mitigated by using a parametric model of atmospheric absorption and regularizing for smooth emissivity estimates. To assess where our estimate is likely accurate, we introduce a technique to detect which scene pixels are significantly influenced by reflected downwelling. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the importance of regularization, temperature differentials, and availability of many spectral bands. We apply our method to longwave infrared (8--13 $Î¼$m) hyperspectral image data acquired from natural scenes with no active illumination. Range features from 15m to 150m are recovered, with good qualitative match to lidar data for pixels classified as having negligible reflected downwelling.

The new approach inherits linear scalability from CAPL and has three novel ingredients. Firstly, to simulate the laser scanning on a solid surface, we discretize the entire simulation domain instead of only the manufacturing toolpath by appending fictitious paths to the manufacturing toolpath. Secondly, to simulate the scanning on overlapping toolpaths, the path-scale simulations are initialized by a Voronoi diagram for line segments discretized from the manufacturing toolpath. Lastly, we propose a modified conduction model that considers the high thermal gradient around the melt pool. We validate the simulation against melt pool images captured with the co-axial melt pool monitoring (MPM) system on the NIST Additive Manufacturing Metrology Testbed (AMMT). Excellent agreements in the length and width of melt pools are found between simulations and experiments conducted on a custom-controlled laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) testbed on a nickel-alloy (IN625) solid surface. To the authors' best knowledge, this paper is the first to validate a full path-scale thermal history with experimentally acquired melt pool images. Comparing the simulation results and the experimental data, we discuss the influence of laser power on the melt pool length on the path-scale level. We also identify the possible ways to further improve the accuracy of the CAPL simulation without sacrificing efficiency.

There is a lack of effective means to mitigate this challenge under the background of gradual compression of the traditional thermal unit construction. Concentrating solar power (CSP) is a promising technology to replace thermal units by integrating emergency boilers to cope with extreme weather, and can meet long-time energy balance as a seasonal peak regulation source. In this paper, we propose a long-term high-resolution expansion planning model of the energy system under high renewable penetration which integrates CSP technology for seasonal energy balance. With the projection to 2050, by taking the energy system in Xinjiang province which is a typical area of the Clean Heating project with rich irradiance as a case study, it shows that the optimal deployment of CSP and electric boiler (EB) can reduce the cost, peak-valley difference of net load and renewable curtailment by 8.73%, 19.72% and 58.24% respectively at 65% renewable penetration compared to the base scenario.

Those severe consequences stem from the heavy smoke emitted from a fire that mostly restricts the visibility of escaping victims and rescuing squad. In such hazardous circumstances, the use of a vision-based human detection system is able to improve the ability to save more lives. To this end, a thermal and infrared imaging fusion strategy based on multiple cameras for human detection in low-visibility scenarios caused by smoke is proposed in this paper. By processing with multiple cameras, vital information can be gathered to generate more useful features for human detection. Firstly, the cameras are calibrated using a Light Heating Chessboard. Afterward, the features extracted from the input images are merged prior to being passed through a lightweight deep neural network to perform the human detection task. The experiments conducted on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano computer demonstrated that the proposed method can process with reasonable speed and can achieve favorable performance with a mAP@0.5 of 95%.

With the development of the RGBT (RGB & Thermal) sensor, the problem of visible (RGB) to Near Infrared (NIR) image fusion has become particularly timely. Indeed, while visible images see color, but suffer from noise, haze, and clouds, the NIR channel captures a clearer picture. The proposed approach fuses these two channels by training a Convolutional Neural Network by Self Supervised Learning (SSL) on a single example. For each such pair, RGB and NIR, the network is trained for seconds to deduce the final fusion. The SSL is based on the comparison of the Structure of Similarity and Edge-Preservation losses, where the labels for the SSL are the input channels themselves. This fusion preserves the relevant detail of each spectral channel without relying on a heavy training process. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves similar or better qualitative and quantitative multispectral fusion results than other state-of-the-art methods that do not rely on heavy training and/or large datasets.

This algorithm is developed using Model Predictive Control. The model of the entire aggregate is dynamically identified using a recursive polynomial model estimation technique. This allows the control to be adaptive, i.e., able to adjust its decisions to the system characteristics, which vary over time due to the daily distribution of users hot water consumption. To answer the demand response requirements, aggregated power variations are realized by modifying the temperature set-points of the water heaters without compromising the users comfort. The developed approach allows tracking a regulation signal and mitigating the so-called rebound, i.e., the recovery of energy needed by the aggregate at the end of the service to return to the baseline thermal state. Analyses in a simulation environment allow the validation of the potentialities of the proposed method.

The $B(H)$ characteristic of iron laminations depends on thermal and mechanical stresses that may have occurred during the manufacturing process. Data-driven modelling and updating of the $B(H)$ characteristic are therefore well known necessities. In this work the $B(H)$ curve of an iron yoke of an accelerator magnet is updated based on observed magnetic flux density data by solving a non-linear inverse problem. The inverse problem is regularized by restricting the solution to the function space that is spanned by the truncated Karhunen Loeve expansion of a stochastic $B(H)$-curve model based on material measurements. It is shown that this method is able to retrieve a previously selected ground truth $B(H)$-curve. With the update of the $B(H)$ characteristic, the numerical model gains predictive capacities for excitation currents that were not included in the data.

After the recession of the seasonal polar ice cap on Mars, small water ice patches may be left behind in shady places due to the low thermal conductivity of the Martian surface and atmosphere. During late spring and early summer, these patches may be exposed to direct sunlight and warm up rapidly enough for the liquid phase to emerge. To see the spatial and temporal occurrence of such ice patches, optical images should be searched for and checked. Previously a manual image analysis was conducted on 110 images from the southern hemisphere, captured by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter space mission. Out of these, 37 images were identified with smaller ice patches, which were distinguishable by their brightness, colour and strong connection to local topographic shading. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to find further images with potential water ice patches in the latitude band between -40Â° and -60Â°, where the seasonal retreat of the polar ice cap happens. Previously analysed HiRISE images were used to train the model, where each image was split into hundreds of pieces (chunks), expanding the training dataset to 6240 images. A test run conducted on 38 new HiRISE images indicates that the program can generally recognise small bright patches, however further training might be needed for more precise identification. This further training has been conducted now, incorporating the results of the previous test run. To retrain the model, 18646 chunks were analysed and 48 additional epochs were ran. In the end the model produced a 94% accuracy in recognising ice, 58% of these images showed small enough ice patches on them. The rest of the images was covered by too much ice or showed CO2 ice sublimation in some places.

Code generation utilities that partition the work into CPU and GPU tasks while considering data movement costs allow researchers to more quickly and easily develop high-performance solutions, and make these resources accessible to a larger user base.
  We present developments for a domain-specific language (DSL) and code generation framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). These enhancements facilitate GPU-accelerated solution of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonons, which is the governing equation for simulating thermal transport in semiconductor materials at sub-micron scales. The solution of the BTE involves thousands of coupled PDEs as well as complicated boundary conditions and nonlinear processing at each time step. These developments enable the DSL to generate configurable hybrid GPU/CPU code that couples accelerated kernels with user-defined code. We observed performance improvements of around 18X compared to a CPU-only version produced by this same DSL with minimal additional programming effort.

However, the unavailability of raw satellite data currently hinders research on lightweight pre-processing techniques and limits the exploration of end-to-end pipelines, which could offer more efficient and accurate extraction of insights directly from the source data. To fill this gap, this work presents a novel methodology to automate the creation of datasets for the detection of target events (e.g., warm thermal hotspots) or objects (e.g., vessels) from Sentinel-2 raw data and other multispectral EO pushbroom raw imagery. The presented approach first processes the raw data by applying a pipeline consisting of spatial band registration and georeferencing of the raw data pixels. Then, it detects the target events by leveraging event-specific state-of-the-art algorithms on the Level-1C products, which are mosaicked and cropped on the georeferenced correspondent raw granule area. The detected events are finally re-projected back onto the corresponding raw images. We apply the proposed methodology to realize THRawS (Thermal Hotspots in Raw Sentinel-2 data), the first dataset of Sentinel-2 raw data containing warm thermal hotspots. THRawS includes 1090 samples containing wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and 33,335 event-free acquisitions to enable thermal hotspot detection and general classification applications. This dataset and associated toolkits provide the community with both an immediately useful resource as well as a framework and methodology acting as a template for future additions. With this work, we hope to pave the way for research on energy-efficient pre-processing algorithms and AI-based end-to-end processing systems on board EO satellites.

Incidents in the recent past indicate that it is becoming necessary to transfer the protective emblem to other dimensions of transmission and representation. (Fully) Autonomous weapon systems are often launched from a great distance to the aiming point and there may be no possibility for the operators to notice protective emblems at the point of impact. In this case, the weapon system would have to detect such protective emblems and, if necessary, disintegrate autonomously or request an abort via human-in-the-loop. In our paper, we suggest ways in which a cross-frequency protective emblem can be designed. On the one hand, the technical deployment, e.g. in the form of RADAR beacons, is considered, as well as the interpretation by methods of machine learning. With regard to the technical deployment, possibilities are considered to address different sensors and to send signals out as resiliently as possible. When considering different signals, approaches are considered as to how software can recognise the protective emblems under the influence of various boundary conditions and react to them accordingly. In particular, a distinction is made here between the recognition of actively emitted signals and passive protective signals, e.g. the recognition of wounded or surrendering persons via drone-based electro-optical and thermal cameras. Finally, methods of distribution are considered, including encryption and authentication of the received signal, and ethical aspects of possible misuse are examined.

The resulting inverse problem is related to acousto-electric tomography, but where the conductivity is complex and only the real power is measured. We study the local solvability of this problem by determining where its linearization is elliptic. Numerical experiments illustrating this inverse problem are included.

This work focuses on two challenges that have been presented when it comes to the accuracy and efficiency in simulating the heat transfer in the fused filament fabrication process. With the prospect of choosing correct thermal boundary conditions expressing the natural convection between printed material and its environment, values for the convective heat transfer coefficient and ambient temperature were calibrated through numerical data fitting of experimental thermal measurements. Furthermore, modeling simplifications were proposed for an efficient numerical discretization of infill structures. Samples were printed with varying infill characteristics, such as varying air void size, infill densities and infill patterns. Thermal measurements were performed to investigate the role of these parameters on the heat transfer and based on these observations, possible modeling simplifications were studied in the numerical simulations.

But in order to capture the significant thermal gradients that occur in the FFF printing process, a fine mesh discretization and short time steps are required, leading to extensive computational efforts. In this work a simulation framework is presented which combines several efficiency measures with the objective of reducing the computational efforts required in simulating the FFF printing process without simplifying the deposition physics or reducing the overall accuracy. Thus, the material deposition has been modeled with a hybrid element activation approach and elements are adaptively coarsened through an error-based coarsening condition. Additionally, an appropriate coarsening technique is presented for geometries with air-filled infill patterns. The accuracy of the numerical framework is experimentally validated and the efficiency of the framework is validated numerically by comparing the performance of models with and without any efficiency measures. Finally, its effectiveness is shown by simulating the printing process of a larger geometry.

Identifying CHF is vital for preventing equipment damage and ensuring overall system safety, yet it is challenging due to the complexity of the phenomena. For an in-depth understanding of the complicated phenomena, various methodologies have been devised, but the acquisition of high-resolution data is limited by the substantial resource consumption required. This study presents a data-driven, image-to-image translation method for reconstructing thermal data of a boiling system at CHF using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). The supervised learning process relies on paired images, which include total reflection visualizations and infrared thermometry measurements obtained from flow boiling experiments. Our proposed approach has the potential to not only provide evidence connecting phase interface dynamics with thermal distribution but also to simplify the laborious and time-consuming experimental setup and data-reduction procedures associated with infrared thermal imaging, thereby providing an effective solution for CHF diagnosis.

This potential determines many materials properties and simulation techniques usually require its gradients, in particular forces and stress for molecular dynamics, and heat flux for thermal transport properties. Recently developed potentials feature high body order and can include equivariant semi-local interactions through message-passing mechanisms. Due to their complex functional forms, they rely on automatic differentiation (AD), overcoming the need for manual implementations or finite-difference schemes to evaluate gradients. This study demonstrates a unified AD approach to obtain forces, stress, and heat flux for such potentials, and provides a model-independent implementation. The method is tested on the Lennard-Jones potential, and then applied to predict cohesive properties and thermal conductivity of tin selenide using an equivariant message-passing neural network potential.

High Dynamic Range (HDR) cameras capture those luminance values in higher resolution through an increase in the number of bpp. Most displays, however, are limited to 8 bpp. Naive HDR compression methods lead to a loss of the rich information contained in those HDR images. In this paper, tone mapping algorithms for thermal infrared images with 16 bpp are investigated that can preserve this information. An optimized multi-scale Retinex algorithm sets the baseline. This algorithm is then approximated with a deep learning approach based on the popular U-Net architecture. The remaining noise in the images after tone mapping is reduced implicitly by utilizing a self-supervised deep learning approach that can be jointly trained with the tone mapping approach in a multi-task learning scheme. Further discussions are provided on denoising and deflickering for thermal infrared video enhancement in the context of tone mapping. Extensive experiments on the public FLIR ADAS Dataset prove the effectiveness of our proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art.

Confirming this hypothesis, several studies concluded that the simultaneous use of optical and thermal images leads to better predictions in crowd counting. However, the way multimodal models extract enriched features from both modalities is not yet fully understood. Since the use of multimodal data usually increases the complexity, inference time, and memory requirements of the models, it is relevant to examine the differences and advantages of multimodal compared to monomodal models. In this work, all available multimodal datasets for crowd counting are used to investigate the differences between monomodal and multimodal models. To do so, we designed a monomodal architecture that considers the current state of research on monomodal crowd counting. In addition, several multimodal architectures have been developed using different multimodal learning strategies. The key components of the monomodal architecture are also used in the multimodal architectures to be able to answer whether multimodal models perform better in crowd counting in general. Surprisingly, no general answer to this question can be derived from the existing datasets. We found that the existing datasets hold a bias toward thermal images. This was determined by analyzing the relationship between the brightness of optical images and crowd count as well as examining the annotations made for each dataset. Since answering this question is important for future real-world applications of crowd counting, this paper establishes criteria for a potential dataset suitable for answering whether multimodal models perform better in crowd counting in general.

We propose a framework for thermal-aware workload distribution in a data center to reduce cooling power consumption. The framework includes linearization of the general optimization problem and proposing a heuristic to approximate the solution for the resulting Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problems. We first define a general nonlinear power optimization problem including several cooling parameters, heat recirculation effects, and constraints on server temperatures. We propose to study a linearized version of the problem, which is easier to analyze. As an energy saving scenario and as a proof of concept for our approach, we also consider the possibility that the red-line temperature for idle servers is higher than that for busy servers. For the resulting ILP problem, we propose a heuristic for intelligent rounding of the fractional solution. Through numerical simulations, we compare our heuristics with two baseline algorithms. We also evaluate the performance of the solution of the linearized system on the original system. The results show that the proposed approach can reduce the cooling power consumption by more than 30 percent compared to the case of continuous utilizations and a single red-line temperature.

This paper systematically investigates the electro-thermal effects in passive RRAM crossbar arrays using COMSOL multi-physics simulations. Furthermore, we propose a methodology to model the thermal cross-talk effect and incorporate it in a SPICE-compatible physics-based RRAM compact model. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of thermal coupling on RRAM crossbar array operation in terms of vector-matrix multiplication using calibrated SPICE simulations.

In this paper, we explain how to apply the GK approach to the recent class of message-passing machine-learning potentials, which iteratively consider semi-local interactions beyond the initial interaction cutoff. We derive an adapted heat flux formulation that can be implemented using automatic differentiation without compromising computational efficiency.

However, real-time feedback control of such devices is currently limited by the absence of suitable state of charge estimation techniques, given the nonlinearities associated with phase change dynamics. In this paper we design and experimentally validate a state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) filter for state of charge estimation in a phase change material (PCM)-based TES device integrated into a single-phase thermal-fluid loop. The advantage of the SDRE filter is that it does not require linearization of the nonlinear finite-volume model; instead, it uses a linear parameter-varying system model which can be quickly derived using graph-based methods. We leverage graph-based methods to prove that the system model is uniformly detectable, guaranteeing that the state estimates are bounded. Using measurements from five thermocouples embedded in the PCM of the TES and two thermocouples measuring the fluid temperature at the inlet and outlet of the device, the state estimator uses a reduced-order finite-volume model to determine the temperature distribution inside the PCM and in turn, the state of charge of the device. We demonstrate the state estimator in simulation and on experimental data collected from a thermal management system testbed to show that the state estimation error converges near zero and remains bounded.

With the advent of high-resolution image sensors and colour filter technologies, multispectral imagers in the visible wavelengths have become popular with increasing commercial viability in the last decade. However, multispectral imaging in longwave infrared (LWIR: 8 to 14 microns) is still an emerging area due to the limited availability of optical materials, filter technologies, and high-resolution sensors. Images from LWIR multispectral cameras can capture emission spectra of objects to extract additional information that a human eye fails to capture and thus have important applications in precision agriculture, forestry, medicine, and object identification. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an LWIR multispectral image sensor with three wavelength bands using optical elements made of an aluminum-based plasmonic filter array sandwiched in germanium. To realize the multispectral sensor, the filter arrays are then integrated into a 3D printed wheel stacked on a low-resolution monochrome thermal sensor. Our prototype device is calibrated using a blackbody and its thermal output has been enhanced with computer vision methods. By applying a state-of-the-art deep learning method, we have also reconstructed multispectral images to a better spatial resolution. Scientifically, our work demonstrates a versatile spectral thermography technique for detecting target signatures in the LWIR range and other advanced spectral analyses.

Due to the gradual phase out of thermal generation, a shift of ancillary services provision like voltage control, congestion management and dynamic support from DERs is underway. Increased planning for procurement of ancillary services from underlying grid levels is required. Therefore, provision of flexible active and reactive power potentials from distribution system operators to transmission system operators at the vertical system interface is a subject of current research. At present, provision of active and reactive power flexibilities (PQ-flexibilities) across radial system interconnections are investigated, which involves a single transformer branch interconnection across two different voltage levels. Inclusion of multiple interconnections in a meshed grid structure increases the complexity as proximal interdependencies of interconnections to PQ-flexibilities require consideration. The objective of this paper is to address the flexibility aggregation across multiple vertical interconnections. Alternating current power transfer distribution factors (AC-PTDFs) are used to determine the power flow across the interconnections. Subsequent integration in a linear optimization environment controls the interconnection power flows (IPF) using a weighted objective function. Therefore, power flow regulation is enabled according to the requirements and specifications of both the underlying and overlaying grid level. The results show interdependent concentric flexibility regions or Feasible Operating Regions (FORs) in accordance with the manipulation of the weighted objective function.

In this work we show that a given Kronecker coefficient is proportional to the rank of a projector that can be measured efficiently using a quantum computer. In other words a Kronecker coefficient counts the dimension of the vector space spanned by the accepting witnesses of a QMA verifier, where QMA is the quantum analogue of NP. This implies that approximating the Kronecker coefficients to within a given relative error is not harder than a certain natural class of quantum approximate counting problems that captures the complexity of estimating thermal properties of quantum many-body systems. A second consequence is that deciding positivity of Kronecker coefficients is contained in QMA, complementing a recent NP-hardness result of Ikenmeyer, Mulmuley and Walter. We obtain similar results for the related problem of approximating row sums of the character table of the symmetric group. Finally, we discuss an efficient quantum algorithm that approximates normalized Kronecker coefficients to inverse-polynomial additive error.

In regions with high subsurface groundwater flow rates, the thermal plume generated from a heat pump's injection well can propagate downstream, affecting surrounding users and reducing their heat pump efficiency. To reduce the probability of interference, regulators often rely on simple analytical models or high fidelity groundwater simulations to determine the impact that a heat pump has on the subsurface aquifer and surrounding heat pumps. These are either too inaccurate or too computationally expensive for everyday use. In this work, a surrogate model was developed to provide a quick, high accuracy prediction tool of the thermal plume generated by a heat pump within heterogeneous subsurface aquifers. Three variations of a convolutional neural network were developed that accepts the known groundwater Darcy velocities as discrete two-dimensional inputs and predicts the temperature within the subsurface aquifer around the heat pump. A data set consisting of 800 numerical simulation samples, generated from random permeability fields and pressure boundary conditions, was used to provide pseudo-randomized Darcy velocity fields as input fields and the temperature field solution for training the network. The subsurface temperature field output from the network provides a more realistic temperature field that follows the Darcy velocity streamlines, while being orders of magnitude faster than conventional high fidelity solvers

However, mass deployment has thus far failed, in part because of the high engineering cost of obtaining and maintaining a sufficiently accurate model. This can be addressed by using adaptive data-driven approaches. The idea of using behavioral systems theory for this purpose has recently found traction in the academic community. In this study, we compare variations thereof with different amounts of data used, different regularization weights, and different methods of data selection. Autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) are used as a well-established reference. All methods are evaluated by performing iterative system identification on two long-term data sets from real occupied buildings, neither of which include artificial excitation for the purpose of system identification. We find that: (1) Sufficient prediction accuracy is achieved with all methods. (2) The ARX models perform slightly better, while having the additional advantages of fewer tuning parameters and faster computation. (3) Adaptive and non-adaptive schemes perform similarly. (4) The regularization weights of the behavioral systems theory methods show the expected trade-off characteristic with an optimal middle value. (5) Using the most recent data yields better performance than selecting data with similar weather as the day to be predicted. (6) More data improves the model performance.

Even though many of these have been previously proposed and evaluated, the operational constraints of real mission scenarios are often either not considered or only rudimentary. Here, we present an open-source Python module called PASEOS that is capable of modelling operational scenarios involving one or multiple spacecraft. It considers several physical phenomena including thermal, power, bandwidth and communications constraints as well as the impact of radiation on spacecraft. PASEOS can be run both as a high-performance-oriented numerical simulation and/or in a real-time mode directly on edge hardware. We demonstrate these capabilities in three scenarios, one in real-time simulation on a Unibap iX-10 100 satellite processor, another in a simulation modelling an entire constellation performing tasks over several hours and one training a machine learning model in a decentralised setting. While we demonstrate tasks in Earth orbit, PASEOS is conceptually designed to allow deep space scenarios too. Our results show that PASEOS can model the described scenarios efficiently and thus provide insight into operational considerations. We show this in terms of runtime and overhead as well as by investigating the modelled temperature, battery status and communication windows of a constellation. By running PASEOS on an actual satellite processor, we showcase how PASEOS can be directly included in hardware demonstrators for future missions. Overall, we provide the first solution to holistically model the physical constraints spacecraft encounter in Earth orbit and beyond. The PASEOS module is available open-source online together with an extensive documentation to enable researchers to quickly incorporate it in their studies.

In this paper, we propose a novel means to predict the temperature gradient distributions during the printing process by making use of neural networks. This is realized by employing heat maps produced by an optimized printing protocol simulation and used for training a specifically tailored recurrent neural network in terms of a long short-term memory architecture. The aim of this is to avoid extreme and inhomogeneous temperature distribution that may occur across the plate in the course of the printing process.
  In order to train the neural network, we adopt a well-engineered simulation and unsupervised learning framework. To maintain a minimized average thermal gradient across the plate, a cost function is introduced as the core criteria, which is inspired and optimized by considering the well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP). As time evolves the unsupervised printing process governed by TSP produces a history of temperature heat maps that maintain minimized average thermal gradient.
  All in one, we propose an intelligent printing tool that provides control over the substantial printing process components for L-PBF, i.e.\ optimal nozzle trajectory deployment as well as online temperature prediction for controlling printing quality.

All major classes of non-volatile memory (NVM) devices have been demonstrated using 2D materials, including their operation as synaptic devices for applications in neuromorphic computing hardware. Their atomically-thin structure, superior physical properties, i.e., mechanical strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, as well as gate-tunable electronic properties provide performance advantages and novel functionality in NVM devices and systems. However, device performance and variability as compared to incumbent materials and technology remain major concerns for real applications. Ultimately, the progress of 2D materials as a novel class of electronic materials and specifically their application in the area of neuromorphic electronics will depend on their scalable synthesis in thin-film form with desired crystal quality, defect density, and phase purity.

This framework addresses the problem of estimating tissue-specific thermodynamics in real-time, which would enable accurate prediction of thermal damage impact to the tissue and damage-conscious planning of electrosurgical procedures. Our approach provides basic thermodynamic information such as thermal diffusivity, and also allows for obtaining the thermal relaxation time and a model of the heat source, yielding in real-time a controlled hyperbolic thermodynamics model. The latter accounts for the finite thermal propagation time necessary for modeling of the electrosurgical action, in which the probe motion speed often surpasses the speed of thermal propagation in the tissue operated on. Our approach relies solely on thermographer feedback and a knowledge of the power level and position of the electrosurgical pencil, imposing only very minor adjustments to normal electrosurgery to obtain a high-fidelity model of the tissue-probe interaction. Our method is minimally invasive and can be performed in situ. We apply our method first to simulated data based on porcine muscle tissue to verify its accuracy and then to in vivo liver tissue, and compare the results with those from the literature. This comparison shows that parameterizing the Maxwell--Cattaneo model through the framework proposed yields a noticeably higher fidelity real-time adaptable representation of the thermodynamic tissue response to the electrosurgical impact than currently available. A discussion on the differences between the live and the dead tissue thermodynamics is also provided.

By using the flexibility of their multi-energy system (MES), they reduce costs and carbon emissions while stabilizing the electricity system. However, to identify the necessary investments in energy conversion and storage technologies to leverage demand response (DR) potentials, companies need to assess the value of flexibility. Therefore, this study quantifies the flexibility value of a production company's MES by optimizing the synthesis, design, and operation of a decarbonizing MES considering self-consumption optimization, peak shaving, and integrated DR based on hourly prices and carbon emission factors (CEFs). The detailed case study of a beverage company in northern Germany considers vehicle-to-X of powered industrial trucks, power-to-heat on multiple temperatures, wind turbines, photovoltaic systems, and energy storage systems (thermal energy, electricity, and hydrogen). We propose and apply novel data-driven metrics to evaluate the intensity of price-based and CEF-based DR. The results reveal that flexibility usage reduces decarbonization costs (by 19-80% depending on electricity and carbon removal prices), total annual costs, operating carbon emissions, energy-weighted average prices and CEFs, and fossil energy dependency. The results also suggest that a net-zero operational carbon emission MES requires flexibility, which, in an economic case, is provided by a combination of different flexible technologies and storage systems that complement each other. While the value of flexibility depends on various market and consumer-specific factors such as electricity or carbon removal prices, this study highlights the importance of demand flexibility for the decarbonization of MESs.

Having already proven this method on time dependent scattering transport problems, we present here solutions to non-equilibrium thermal radiative transfer problems for familiar linearized systems together with more physical nonlinear systems in both optically thin and thick regimes, including both the full transport and the $S_2$/$P_1$ solution. Geometric convergence is observed for smooth sources at all times and some nonsmooth sources at late times when there is local equilibrium. Also, accurate solutions are achieved for step sources when the solution is not smooth.

It can store up to 5 billion tons of CO2 per year. To guarantee a safe and economical geological storage, the well cement degradation and wellbore integrity need to be studied thoroughly. This review paper is designed to provide a fundamental background of well cement degradation and wellbore integrity in geological CO2 storages to support the researchers in further investigation. The review mainly focuses on mechanical, thermal, chemical property changes and corrosion time for cement in experiments and simulation during geological CO2 storage. However, the debonding interface between casing/cement or cement/formation has not been addressed profoundly. A further investigation should inspect how pressure, temperature, and chemical reaction affect the micro-annuli of casing/cement or cement/formation. Also, a mathe-matical model should be established to predict the corrosion rate in geological CO2 storage.

The distortion has a great influence on the structural performance and dimensional accuracy, e.g., for assembly. It is therefore of critical importance to model, predict and, ultimately, reduce distortion. In this paper, we present a computational framework for fabrication sequence optimization to minimize distortion in multi-axis additive manufacturing (e.g., robotic wire arc additive manufacturing), in which the fabrication sequence is not limited to planar layers only. We encode the fabrication sequence by a continuous pseudo-time field, and optimize it using gradient-based numerical optimization. To demonstrate this framework, we adopt a computationally tractable yet reasonably accurate model to mimic the material shrinkage in metal additive manufacturing and thus to predict the distortion of the fabricated components. Numerical studies show that optimized curved layers can reduce distortion by orders of magnitude as compared to their planar counterparts.

Towards parameterized problem inference</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained much attention in various fields of engineering thanks to their capability of incorporating physical laws into the models. PINNs integrate the physical constraints by minimizing the partial differential equations (PDEs) residuals on a set of collocation points. The distribution of these collocation points appears to have a huge impact on the performance of PINNs and the assessment of the sampling methods for these points is still an active topic. In this paper, we propose a Fixed-Budget Online Adaptive Learning (FBOAL) method, which decomposes the domain into sub-domains, for training collocation points based on local maxima and local minima of the PDEs residuals. The effectiveness of FBOAL is demonstrated for non-parameterized and parameterized problems. The comparison with other adaptive sampling methods is also illustrated. The numerical results demonstrate important gains in terms of the accuracy and computational cost of PINNs with FBOAL over the classical PINNs with non-adaptive collocation points. We also apply FBOAL in a complex industrial application involving coupling between mechanical and thermal fields. We show that FBOAL is able to identify the high-gradient locations and even give better predictions for some physical fields than the classical PINNs with collocation points sampled on a pre-adapted finite element mesh built thanks to numerical expert knowledge. From the present study, it is expected that the use of FBOAL will help to improve the conventional numerical solver in the construction of the mesh.

That is, we aim at computing the velocity at which a forced heat source melts through a phase-change material. Existing approaches found in the literature consider a thermo-mechanical equilibrium in the contact melt film, which results in a constant melting velocity of the heat source. This classical approach, however, cannot account for transient effects in which the melting velocity adjusts itself to equilibrium conditions. With our contribution, we derive a model for the transient melting process of a planar heat source. We iteratively cycle between solving for the heat equation in the solid material and updating the melting velocity. The latter is computed based on the heat flux in the vicinity of the heat source. The motion of the heated body is simulated via the moving mesh strategy referred to as the Virtual Region Shear-Slip Mesh Update Method, which avoids remeshing and is particularly efficient in representing unidirectional movement. We show numerical examples to validate our methodology and present two application scenarios, a 2D planar thermal melting probe and a 2D hot-wire cutting machine.

At the current stage, the technology portfolio of dominant storage options is limited to pumped-hydro storage and Li-Ion batteries. It is uncertain which storage design will be able to compete with these options. Considering Europe as a case study, we derive the cost and efficiency requirements of a generic storage technology, which we refer to as storage-X, to be deployed in the cost-optimal system. This is performed while including existing pumped-hydro facilities and accounting for the competition from stationary Li-ion batteries, flexible generation technology, and flexible demand in a highly renewable sector-coupled energy system. Based on a sample space of 724 storage configurations, we show that energy capacity cost and discharge efficiency largely determine the optimal storage deployment, in agreement with previous studies. Here, we show that charge capacity cost is also important due to its impact on renewable curtailment. A significant deployment of storage-X in a cost-optimal system requires (a) discharge efficiency of at least 95%, (b) discharge efficiency of at least 50% together with low energy capacity cost (10EUR/kWh), or (c) discharge efficiency of at least 25% with very low energy capacity cost (2EUR/kWh). Comparing our findings with seven emerging technologies reveals that none of them fulfill these requirements. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is, however, on the verge of qualifying due to its low energy capacity cost and concurrent low charge capacity cost. Exploring the space of storage designs reveals that system cost reduction from storage-X deployment can reach 9% at its best, but this requires high round-trip efficiency (90%) and low charge capacity cost (35EUR/kW).

In this regime, for a lossy-bosonic channel with additive thermal noise, the ratio between the entanglement-assisted capacity and the Holevo capacity - the maximum reliable-communications rate permitted by quantum mechanics without any pre-shared entanglement - scales as $\log(1/{\bar N}_{\rm S})$, where the mean transmitted photon number per mode, ${\bar N}_{\rm S} \ll 1$. Thus, pre-shared entanglement, e.g., distributed by the quantum internet or a satellite-assisted quantum link, promises to significantly improve low-power radio-frequency communications. In this paper, we propose a pair of structured quantum transceiver designs that leverage continuous-variable pre-shared entanglement generated, e.g., from a down-conversion source, binary phase modulation, and non-Gaussian joint detection over a code word block, to achieve this scaling law of capacity enhancement. Further, we describe a modification to the aforesaid receiver using a front-end that uses sum-frequency generation sandwiched with dynamically-programmable in-line two-mode squeezers, and a receiver back-end that takes full advantage of the output of the receiver's front-end by employing a non-destructive multimode vacuum-or-not measurement to achieve the entanglement-assisted classical communications capacity.

Developing building occupant personas is proven to be an effective method for human-centered smart building design, which considers occupant comfort, behavior, and energy consumption. Optimization of building energy consumption also requires a deep understanding of occupants' preferences and behaviors. The current approaches to developing building occupant personas face a major obstruction of manual data processing and analysis. In this study, we propose and evaluate a machine learning-based semi-automated approach to generate building occupant personas. We investigate the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Dataset with five machine learning techniques - Linear Discriminant Analysis, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (Random Forest), Support Vector Machine, and AdaBoost classifier - for the prediction of 16 occupant characteristics, such as age, education, and, thermal comfort. The models achieve an average accuracy of 61% and accuracy over 90% for attributes including the number of occupants in the household, their age group, and preferred usage of heating or cooling equipment. The results of the study show the feasibility of using machine learning techniques for the development of building occupant persona to minimize human effort.

Data-driven models taking advantage of the latest developed computational tools can serve as a more efficient surrogate, but they are usually trained over a large amount of simulation data and often fail to effectively use small but high-quality experimental data. In this work, we developed a hybrid physics-based data-driven thermal modeling approach of AM processes using physics-informed neural networks. Specifically, partially observed temperature data measured from an infrared camera is combined with the physics laws to predict full-field temperature history and to discover unknown material and process parameters. In the numerical and experimental examples, the effectiveness of adding auxiliary training data and using the pretrained model on training efficiency and prediction accuracy, as well as the ability to identify unknown parameters with partially observed data, are demonstrated. The results show that the hybrid thermal model can effectively identify unknown parameters and capture the full-field temperature accurately, and thus it has the potential to be used in iterative process design and real-time process control of AM.

If, during the execution of a software workload, the running average of any electrical or thermal parameter exceeds its corresponding predefined threshold value, the power management architecture will reactively adjust CPU frequency to ensure safe operating conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate how such power management-based frequency throttling activity forms a source of timing side-channel information leakage, which can be exploited by an attacker to infer secret data even from a constant-cycle victim workload. The proposed frequency throttling side-channel attack can be launched by both kernel-space and user-space attackers, thus compromising security guarantees provided by isolation boundaries. We validate our attack methodology across different systems and threat models by performing experiments on a constant-cycle implementation of AES algorithm based on AES-NI instructions. The results of our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the attacker can successfully recover all bytes of an AES key by measuring encryption execution times. Finally, we discuss different options to mitigate the threat posed by frequency throttling side-channel attacks, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.

Focusing on pixel mapping we argue that adding thermal noise to the system yields better visual impressions than that obtained from a simple energy minimization. To quantify this observation, we introduce the coarse-grained quantization error, and seek the optimal temperature which minimizes this new observable. By comparing images with different structural properties, we show that the optimal temperature is a good proxy for complexity at different scales. Noting that the convoluted error is a key observable, we directly minimize it using a Monte Carlo algorithm to generate a new series of quantized images. Adopting an original approach based on the informativity of finite size samples, we are able to determine the optimal convolution parameter leading to the best visuals. Finally, we test the robustness of our method against changes in image type, color palette and convolution kernel.

Optimally controlling such out-of-equilibrium systems is a crucial yet challenging task with applications to quantum technologies and devices. We introduce a general model-free framework based on Reinforcement Learning to identify out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic cycles that are Pareto optimal trade-offs between power and efficiency for quantum heat engines and refrigerators. The method does not require any knowledge of the quantum thermal machine, nor of the system model, nor of the quantum state. Instead, it only observes the heat fluxes, so it is both applicable to simulations and experimental devices. We test our method on a model of an experimentally realistic refrigerator based on a superconducting qubit, and on a heat engine based on a quantum harmonic oscillator. In both cases, we identify the Pareto-front representing optimal power-efficiency tradeoffs, and the corresponding cycles. Such solutions outperform previous proposals made in the literature, such as optimized Otto cycles, reducing quantum friction.

The purpose of our framework is to fuse two modalities, including visible and thermal infrared images captured by drones in real-time, that exploit the complementary information to accurately count the dense population and then automatically guide the flight of the drone to supervise the dense crowd. To this end, we propose the unified multi-task learning framework for crowd counting for the first time and re-design the unified training loss functions to align the image fusion network and crowd counting network. We also design the Assisted Learning Module (ALM) to fuse the density map feature to the image fusion encoder process for learning the counting features. To improve the accuracy, we propose the Extensive Context Extraction Module (ECEM) that is based on a dense connection architecture to encode multi-receptive-fields contextual information and apply the Multi-domain Attention Block (MAB) for concerning the head region in the drone view. Finally, we apply the prediction map to automatically guide the drones to supervise the dense crowd. The experimental results on the DroneRGBT dataset show that, compared with the existing methods, ours has comparable results on objective evaluations and an easier training process.

We prove the existence and uniqueness results and perform the spatial discretization using the finite element and the temporal discretization using a fractional exponential integrator scheme. We provide the temporal and spatial convergence proofs for our fully discrete scheme and the result shows that the convergence orders depend on the regularity of the initial data, the power of the fractional derivative, and the Hurst parameter $H$.

Here we study the computational complexity of approximating these quantities for $n$-qubit local Hamiltonians. First, we report a classical algorithm with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ runtime which approximates the free energy of a given $2$-local Hamiltonian provided that it satisfies a certain denseness condition. Our algorithm combines the variational characterization of the free energy and convex relaxation methods. It contributes to a body of work on efficient approximation algorithms for dense instances of optimization problems which are hard in the general case, and can be viewed as simultaneously extending existing algorithms for (a) the ground energy of dense $2$-local Hamiltonians, and (b) the free energy of dense classical Ising models. Secondly, we establish polynomial-time equivalence between the problem of approximating the free energy of local Hamiltonians and three other natural quantum approximate counting problems, including the problem of approximating the number of witness states accepted by a QMA verifier. These results suggest that simulation of quantum many-body systems in thermal equilibrium may precisely capture the complexity of a broad family of computational problems that has yet to be defined or characterized in terms of known complexity classes. Finally, we summarize state-of-the-art classical and quantum algorithms for approximating the free energy and show how to improve their runtime and memory footprint.

Early detection of these faults is crucial for battery safety and widespread deployment of fast charging. In this setting, we propose a real-time {detection} framework for battery voltage and thermal faults. A major challenge in battery fault detection arises from the effect of uncertainties originating from sensor inaccuracies, nominal aging, or unmodelled dynamics. Inspired by physics-based learning, we explore a detection paradigm that combines physics-based models, model-based detection observers, and data-driven learning techniques to address this challenge. Specifically, we construct the {detection} observers based on an experimentally identified electrochemical-thermal model, and subsequently design the observer tuning parameters following Lyapunov's stability theory. Furthermore, we utilize Gaussian Process Regression technique to learn the model and measurement uncertainties which in turn aid the {detection} observers in distinguishing faults and uncertainties. Such uncertainty learning essentially helps suppressing their effects, potentially enabling early detection of faults. We perform simulation and experimental case studies on the proposed fault {detection} scheme verifying the potential of physics-based learning in early detection of battery faults.

Such simulations are needed for the optimal control and management of residential heating systems equipped with an underground thermal storage. There a given volume under or aside of a building is filled with soil and insulated to the surrounding ground. The thermal energy is stored by raising the temperature of the soil inside the storage. It is charged and discharged via pipe heat exchangers filled with a moving fluid. Simulations of geothermal energy storages aim to determine how much energy can be stored in or taken from the storage within a given short period of time. The latter depends on the dynamics of the spatial temperature distribution in the storage which is governed by a linear heat equation with convection and appropriate boundary and interface conditions. We consider semi- and full discretization of that PDE using finite difference schemes and study associated stability problems. Numerical results based on the derived methods are presented in the companion paper [17].

This process enables computational analyses on ensembles of microstructures without having to perform exhaustive and costly experimental characterizations. Statistical functions-based and deep learning-based methods are among the stochastic microstructure reconstruction approaches applicable to a wide range of material systems. In this paper, we integrate statistical descriptors as well as feature maps from a pre-trained deep neural network into an overall loss function for an optimization based reconstruction procedure. This helps us to achieve significant computational efficiency in reconstructing microstructures that retain the critically important physical properties of the target microstructure. A numerical example for the microstructure reconstruction of bi-phase random porous ceramic material demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed methodology. We further perform a detailed finite element analysis (FEA) of the reconstructed microstructures to calculate effective elastic modulus, effective thermal conductivity and effective hydraulic conductivity, in order to analyse the algorithm's capacity to capture the variability of these material properties with respect to those of the target microstructure. This method provides an economic, efficient and easy-to-use approach for reconstructing random multiphase materials in 2D which has the potential to be extended to 3D structures.

These include state-dependent actuator limitations, asymmetric control bounds, and thermal loads that vary with maneuvering conditions. This paper introduces an iterative control allocation method to address these challenges in real time. The proposed algorithm searches for control inputs that achieve the desired moment commands while respecting constraints on input magnitude and rate. For slender HGV configurations, thermal loads and drag generation are strongly correlated-lower drag typically results in reduced surface heating. By embedding drag-sensitive soft constraints, the method improves energy efficiency and implicitly reduces surface temperatures, lowering the vehicle's infrared signature. These features are particularly advantageous for long-range military operations that require low observability. The approach is demonstrated using the DLR's Generic Hypersonic Glide Vehicle 2 (GHGV-2) simulation model. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in maintaining control authority under realistic, constrained flight conditions.

This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results demonstrate that the LCOE of this self-sustaining system can be competitive with conventional dispatchable generators, such as gas turbines. Furthermore, at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, a Si-based system can also achieve an LCOE comparable to that of traditional gas-turbine power plants, despite having a lower conversion efficiency than its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging silicon's immense manufacturing scalability, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.

Available datasets for thermal imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge, this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration pipeline.

We show that for a wave field with random phases, the normal form transformation is valid by dominant probability if $β\ll 1/N^{1+ε}$, with $N$ the number of masses and $ε$ an arbitrarily small constant. To obtain this condition, a bound is needed for a summation in the transformation equation, which we prove rigorously in the paper. The condition also suggests that the importance of the non-resonant terms in the evolution equation is governed by the parameter $βN$. We design numerical experiments to demonstrate that this is indeed the case for spectra at both thermal-equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium conditions. The methodology developed in this paper is applicable to other Hamiltonian systems where a normal form transformation needs to be applied.

This chapter provides an overview of electrical system architectures for electric and hybrid electric aircraft, highlighting both established principles and emerging design strategies. The discussion begins with the motivations for electrification, including reducing environmental impact, improving operational efficiency, and replacing complex pneumatic and hydraulic subsystems with lighter and more reliable electrical alternatives. Aircraft electrical architectures are classified into four major categories: conventional, more electric, all electric, and hybrid electric. A range of system topologies is examined, including direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), hybrid, and distributed configurations. Each is considered in terms of its effectiveness in delivering power, enabling redundancy, supporting fault isolation, and managing thermal performance. Real world examples are presented to demonstrate practical applications, with case studies drawn from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the Eviation Alice commuter aircraft, and NASA X57 Maxwell demonstrator. These examples illustrate the ongoing transition from incremental subsystem electrification toward fully integrated architectures that promise higher efficiency and greater sustainability.

Rydberg atoms - typically alkali atoms with a highly excited valence electron that is far from the nucleus - exhibit strong sensitivity to external electromagnetic fields. This sensitivity leads to coupling between different atomic energy levels, which can be observed by monitoring changes in a control laser beam before and after it passes through a vapor cell containing the Rydberg atoms. By analyzing the transmitted laser signal with a photodetector, variations in transmission can be attributed to the presence and characteristics of the external electromagnetic field. Because Rydberg atoms operate in a highly excited quantum state without relying on traditional electronic circuitry, they inherently avoid thermal noise, thereby enabling more sensitive detection. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a Rydberg atomic receiver based on Rb-85 and compare it with that of a conventional receiver in detecting an 8-level pulse amplitude modulation (8-PAM) signal in the presence of off-resonant interference. We demonstrate that the Rydberg receiver can suppress interference without the need for an additional filter. Effectively, our results show that the Rydberg receiver serves as an integrated filter and demodulator, outperforming conventional circuit-based receivers in terms of achievable symbol error rate

Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on 50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91 for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1 Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow, we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units, spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity, power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond thermoelectrics.

Emerging approaches to tackle this issue include cryogenic CMOS electronics at 4 K, and photonic links for direct qubit control. In this paper, we propose a multiplexed all-passive cryogenic high frequency direct detection control platform (cryo-HFDD). The proposed classical interface for direct qubit control utilizes optical or sub-THz bands. We present the possible tradeoffs of this platform, and compare it with current state-of-the-art cryogenic CMOS and conventional coaxial approaches. We assess the feasibility of adopting these efficient links for a wide range of microwave qubit power levels. Specifically, we estimate the heat load to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio SNR considering different noise sources, component losses, as well as link density. We show that multiplexed photonic receivers at 4 K can aggressively scale the control of thousands of qubits. This opens the door for low cost scalable quantum computing systems.

While conventional fall prevention systems typically rely on post-fall detection or reactive alerts, they also often suffer from high false positive rates and fail to address the underlying patient needs that lead to bed-exit attempts. This paper presents a novel system architecture that leverages the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) to orchestrate human-robot-robot interaction for proactive and personalized patient assistance. The system integrates a privacy-preserving thermal sensing model capable of real-time bed-exit prediction, with two coordinated robotic agents that respond dynamically based on predicted intent and patient input. This orchestrated response could not only reduce fall risk but also attend to the patient's underlying motivations for movement, such as thirst, discomfort, or the need for assistance, before a hazardous situation arises. Our contributions with this pilot study are three-fold: (1) a modular IoRT-based framework enabling distributed sensing, prediction, and multi-robot coordination; (2) a demonstration of low-resolution thermal sensing for accurate, privacy-preserving preemptive bed-exit detection; and (3) results from a user study and systematic error analysis that inform the design of situationally aware, multi-agent interactions in hospital settings. The findings highlight how interactive and connected robotic systems can move beyond passive monitoring to deliver timely, meaningful assistance, empowering safer, more responsive care environments.

However, challenges such as class imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency. Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4 and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce \emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO} attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only \textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO} effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge deployment in urban environments.

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of integrating an enhanced LIV SDK-like MR compositing pipeline into the Meta Quest 3 hardware, enabling native first-person physical perspective (FPP) MR content creation without external infrastructure. We conducted a simulation-based feasibility study using hardware specifications, developer documentation, and benchmarking with ARM-based SoCs, including Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and MediaTek Dimensity 9300. The approach suggested Camera Passthrough Enhancement using Meta's experimental Passthrough Camera API with on-device machine learning segmentation through Unity Sentis and FastSAM, and an optimized real-time compositing engine for standalone VR. Benchmarking results show that Quest 3's Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 can support lightweight native MR compositing at 720p30 resolution using 95\% resource utilization, leaving 5\% thermal headroom for sustained runtime. Comparison with next-generation SoCs such as Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 demonstrates 34\% headroom, enabling more robust MR experiences with 1.5--2x faster CPU/GPU performance and higher memory bandwidth. While current Quest 3 hardware supports basic native MR compositing, thermal limits restrict operation to 5--10 minutes before throttling. Experimental results confirm standalone MR content creation is possible on current hardware for short recordings, with new XR SoCs offering the headroom for extended sessions and improved quality. These findings lay groundwork for transitioning MR content creation from PC-based workflows to all-in-one VR devices, enhancing MR production for content creators and researchers.

These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions. Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision, 95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92 percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything (CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot that uses upgraded microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot validation study, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. Key upgrades, such as beamforming microphones and low-latency audio processing, reduced artifacts like self-hearing and improved multi-party separation. Expanded visual and thermal sensing established a foundation for future interaction capabilities. Beyond the NAO, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.

Effective thermal management is essential to ensure part quality and structural integrity, as thermal gradients and residual stresses can lead to defects such as warping and cracking. However, existing experimental or computational techniques lack the ability to forecast future temperature distributions in real time, an essential capability for proactive process control. This paper presents a real-time thermal state forecasting framework for L-PBF, based on a physics-informed reduced-order thermal model integrated with a Kalman filtering scheme. The proposed approach efficiently captures inter-layer heat transfer dynamics and enables accurate tracking and forecasting of spatial and temporal temperature evolution. Validation across multiple part geometries using measured data demonstrates that the method reliably estimates and forecasts peak temperatures and cooling trends. By enabling predictive thermal control, this framework offers a practical and computationally efficient solution for thermal management in L-PBF, paving the way toward closed-loop control in L-PBF.

Optimal TES control and management are essential to improve the performance of the cooling system. Most existing TES systems operate on a fixed schedule, which cannot take full advantage of its load shifting capability, and requires extensive investigation and optimization. This study proposed a novel integrated load prediction and optimized control approach for ice-based TES in commercial buildings. A cooling load prediction model was developed and a mid-day modification mechanism was introduced into the prediction model to improve the accuracy. Based on the predictions, a rule-based control strategy was proposed according to the time-of-use tariff; the mid-day control adjustment mechanism was introduced in accordance with the mid-day prediction modifications. The proposed approach was applied in the ice-based TES system of a commercial complex in Beijing, and achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 389 kW and coefficient of variance of MAE of 12.5%. The integrated prediction-based control strategy achieved an energy cost saving rate of 9.9%. The proposed model was deployed in the realistic building automation system of the case building and significantly improved the efficiency and automation of the cooling system.

The internal microstructure of a 3D printed component can have a significant impact on its mechanical, vibrational, and shock properties and allows for a richer design space when this is controllable. Due to the complex interactions of the internal geometry of an extrusion-based AM component, it is common practice to assume a homogeneous behavior or to perform characterization testing on the specific toolpath configurations. To avoid unnecessary testing or material waste, it is necessary to develop an accurate and consistent numerical simulation framework with relevant boundary value problems that can handle the complicated geometry of internal material microstructure present in AM components. Herein, a framework is proposed to directly create computational meshes suitable for finite element analysis (FEA) of the fine-scale features generated from extrusion-based AM tool paths to maintain a strong process-structure-property-performance linkage. This mesh can be manually or automatically analyzed using standard FEA simulations such as quasi-static preloading, modal analysis, or thermal analysis. The framework allows an in-silico assessment of a target AM geometry where fine-scale features may greatly impact quantities of design interest such as in soft elastomeric lattices where toolpath infill can greatly influence the self contact of a structure in compression, which we will use as a motivating exemplar. This approach greatly reduces the waste of both time and resources consumed through traditional build and test design cycles for non-intuitive design spaces. It also further allows for the exploration of toolpath infill to optimize component properties beyond simple linear properties such as density and stiffness.

However, measurements are typically collected from sparsely distributed sensors, offering limited coverage over the domain of interest and phenomena of interest. Determination of the spatial configuration of these sensors is crucial and challenging during the pre-test design stage. This paper develops a data-driven framework for optimizing sensor placement in TH experiments, including (i) a sensitivity analysis to construct datasets, (ii) Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for dimensionality reduction, and (iii) QR factorization with column pivoting to determine optimal sensor configuration under spatial constraints. The framework is demonstrated on a test conducted in the TALL-3D Lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) loop. In this case, the utilization of optical techniques, such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), are impractical. Thereby the quantification of momentum and energy transport relies heavily on readings from Thermocouples (TCs). The test section was previously instrumented with many TCs determined through a manual process combining simulation results with expert judgement. The proposed framework provides a systematic and automated approach for sensor placement. The resulting TCs exhibit high sensitivity to the variation of uncertain input parameters and enable accurate full field reconstruction while maintaining robustness against measurement noise.

Although Hamiltonian learning has been extensively investigated, two issues recur in much of the existing literature: the absence of matching lower bounds and the use of mathematically convenient but physically opaque error measures. We address both challenges by introducing two physically motivated distances between Hamiltonians and designing a nearly optimal algorithm with respect to one of these metrics. The first, time-constrained distance, quantifies distinguishability through dynamical evolution up to a bounded time. The second, temperature-constrained distance, captures distinguishability through thermal states at bounded inverse temperatures. We show that $s$-sparse Hamiltonians with bounded operator norm can be learned in both distances with $O(s \log(1/ε))$ experiments and $O(s^2/ε)$ evolution time. For the time-constrained distance, we further establish lower bounds of $Ω((s/n)\log(1/ε) + s)$ experiments and $Ω(\sqrt{s}/ε)$ evolution time, demonstrating near-optimality in the number of experiments. As an intermediate result, we obtain an algorithm that learns every Pauli coefficient of $s$-sparse Hamiltonians up to error $ε$ in $O(s\log(1/ε))$ experiments and $O(s/ε)$ evolution time, improving upon several recent results. The source of this improvement is a new isolation technique, inspired by the Valiant-Vazirani theorem (STOC'85), which shows that NP is as easy as detecting unique solutions. This isolation technique allows us to query the time evolution of a single Pauli coefficient of a sparse Hamiltonian--even when the Pauli support of the Hamiltonian is unknown--ultimately enabling us to recover the Pauli support itself.

A case study</a></div></span></div><div id = 'abs'>Abstract:</br> <span id = 'abs'>Achieving net-zero targets requires the phase-out of fossil-based heating. A major challenge is the seasonal mismatch between renewable heat supply and demand. District heating networks often dispose of excess heat in summer and rely on fossil backups in winter. Large-scale thermal energy storage offers a solution by storing surplus summer heat for use during winter, thus reducing the need for fossil fuels. This study investigates the feasibility of a large-scale thermal storage system at a power production site that supplies a large district heating network in the city of Bern, Switzerland. Specifically, the study examines the potential of a geothermal storage system to offset fossil fuel heat generation in winter by utilising heat stored during the summer months. Using a Python-based multi-energy system model, we simulate the optimal operation of the geothermal storage system with respect to cost and emissions, considering both supply and demand on an hourly basis over one year. Multi-objective optimisation is applied to generate a Pareto-optimal front. The results show that the geothermal storage system eliminates the requirement of 8 GWh of gas-powered heat supply and increases the waste heat utilisation by 20%, therefore lowering emissions. This effect is further increased when combined with an expansion of the district heating network, as individual, emission-heavy heaters are replaced by low-emission heat from the district heating network. The findings presented in this study can prove useful when evaluating similar systems across Switzerland.

Reliable assessment of TPS performance depends on accurate ablation models. New finite-rate gas-surface chemistry models are advancing state-of-the-art in TPS ablation modeling, but model reductions that omit chemical species and reactions may be necessary in some cases for computational tractability. This work develops hybrid physics-based and data-driven enrichments to improve the predictive capability and quantify uncertainties in such low-fidelity models while maintaining computational tractability. We focus on discrepancies in predicted carbon monoxide production that arise because the low-fidelity model tracks only a subset of reactions. To address this, we embed targeted enrichments into the low-fidelity model to capture the influence of omitted reactions. Numerical results show that the hybrid enrichments significantly improve predictive accuracy while requiring the addition of only three reactions.

By integrating PeTTO with phase field methods, the partial differential equations (PDEs) constrained optimization problem in topology optimization is transformed into a set of time dependent PDEs, which can be analyzed using the knowledge of transient physics. The sensitivities with respect to the design variable are calculated with the automatic differentiation which help avoid tedious and error-prone manual derivations. The overall system of equations is efficiently solved using a hybrid of the pseudo-transient method and the accelerated pseudo-transient method, balancing the convergence rate and numerical stability. A variety of numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PeTTO approach. These examples cover different physics scenarios including mechanical and thermal problems, as well as single-material and multi-materials cases in both 2D and 3D. The numerical results show a 40- to 50-fold speedup when running the same PeTTO code on a single GPU compared to desktop CPUs. This work helps bridge the gap between high-performance computing and topology optimization, potentially enabling faster and better designs for real-world problems.

Recent developments in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data, particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines.

We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based models may further sharpen edges.

The objectives of the present work is to enable integration with existing controllers, in this case Valve Index controllers, and to propose an alternative approach to managing thermal stimulation with Peltier modules by controlling heat flow instead of temperature. We introduce StimulHeat as a wireless, low power thermal feedback system, based on the continuous relationship between heat and current injection in thermoelectric device (TED). First, we designed an optimized TED driver capable of injecting a continuous, bidirectional current into the TED, thereby driving it as a heater or cooler. Subsequently, this driver was implemented in an electronic board to include temperature and heat flow control loops, as well as Bluetooth Low Energy interface for remote control. A mechanical integration was conducted, in the form of a controller extension which is non-intrusive and can be clipped to Valve Index controllers to enclose the TED, temperature sensors and electronics. Finally, we present a user study validating StimulHeat for use in Virtual Reality, utilizing a Unity-built virtual environment with our open-source package.

In the long-time limit, the velocity distribution function of these particles tends towards a thermal non-equilibrium $κ$-distribution function which is a steady-state of the considered Fokker-Planck equation. These $κ$-distribution functions have the particularity of being only algebraically decaying for large velocities, thus describing very well suprathermal particle populations. Our aim is to present two efficient spectral methods for the simulation of such energetic particle dynamics. The first method will be based on rational Chebyshev basis functions, rather than on Hermite basis sets, which are the basis of choice for Maxwellian steady states. The second method is based on a different polynomial basis set, constructed via the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation process. These two new spectral schemes, specifically adapted to the here considered physical context, shall permit to cope with the long-time asymptotics without significant numerical costs.

While hardware-based thermal displays can provide accurate temperature changes, they are often bulky, power-intensive, and restrict user mobility. Consequently, recent works have explored thermal illusions, perceptual effects that rely on cross-modal interactions, to achieve thermal experiences without physical heating or cooling. While thermal illusions have been shown to consistently alter subjective ratings, the actual extent of their effect on the perceived temperature of interacted objects remains unexplored. To address this, we contribute the findings of two user studies following psychophysical procedures. We first ordered and scaled the effects of a variety of visual and auditory cues (N=20) and subsequently quantified their isolated and combined efficacy in offsetting physical temperature changes (N=24). We found that thermal illusions elicited robust changes in subjective judgments, and auditory cues showed potential as an alternative or complementary approach to established visual techniques. However, the actual effects induced by thermal illusions were relatively small (+-0.5°C) and did not consistently align with abstract ratings, suggesting a need to reconsider how future thermal illusions or experiences are designed and evaluated.

The model is calculated by a CCM/PD alternating solution based on the finite element discretization, which ensures the calculation accuracy and facilitates engineering applications. The original PD model defines damage solely based on the number of broken bonds in the vicinity of the material point, neglecting the distribution of these bonds. To address this limitation, a new definition of the PD damage accounting for both the number of broken bonds and their specific distribution is proposed. As a result, damage in various directions can be captured, enabling more realistic thermal fracture simulations based on a unified mesh discretization. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated by comparing numerical examples with analytical solutions. Moreover, simulation results of quasi-static and dynamic crack propagation demonstrate the model's ability to aid in understanding the initiation and propagation mechanisms of complex thermal fractures.

This study introduces a novel, color-based computer analysis (CBCA) method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning (ML) to quantify colorimetric shifts in potassium iodide (KI) solutions during oxidation. First, a custom-built visual data acquisition system captured high-resolution video of the color transitions in a KI solution during oxidation with an NTP system. The change in [Ox]_{tot} during the experiments was monitored with a standard titrimetric method. Second, the captured frames were processed using a robust image processing pipeline to extract RGB, HSV, and Lab color features. The extracted features were statistically evaluated, and the results revealed strong linear correlations with the measured [Ox]_{tot} values, particularly in the saturation (HSV), a and b (Lab), and blue (RGB) channels. Subsequently, the [Ox]_{tot} measurements and the extracted color features were used to train and validate five ML models. Among them, linear regression and gradient boosting models achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.990). It was also found that reducing the feature set from nine to four resulted in comparable performance with improved prediction efficiency, especially for gradient boosting. Finally, comparison of the model predictions with real titration measurements revealed that the CBCA system successfully predicts the [Ox]_{tot} in KI solution with high accuracy (R^2 > 0.998) even with a reduced number of features.

However, its widespread use is hampered by the time-consuming nature of running an experiment and the significant domain knowledge required. Recent studies have shown the value of multiple forms of automation in improving this, but their use is limited due to the difficulty of integrating them with SPMs other than the one it was developed for. With this in mind, we propose an automation framework for SPMs aimed toward facilitating code sharing and reusability of developed components. Our framework defines generic control and data structure schemas which are passed among independent software processes (components), with the final SPM commands sent after passing through an SPM-specific translator. This approach permits multi-language support and allows for experimental components to be decoupled among multiple computers. Our mediation logic limits access to the SPM to a single component at a time, with a simple override mechanism in order to correct detected experiment problems. To validate our proposal, we integrated and tested it with two SPMs from separate manufacturers, and ran an experiment involving a thermal drift correction component.

A central challenge is whether capacity markets (CMs), originally designed around thermal generation, can provide efficient investment signals when storage becomes a central participant. While recent studies have advanced methods for accrediting variable renewables and short-duration storage, the effectiveness of these methods in CMs with substantial LDES penetration remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we extend a two-stage stochastic equilibrium investment model by endogenising continuous, duration-based capacity accreditation for storage and apply it to a Great Britain-based case using 40 years of weather-driven demand and renewable profiles under varying emission limits. Results show that well-calibrated CMs can sustain near-efficient investment and mitigate revenue volatility, but their effectiveness diminishes in deeply decarbonized systems, underscoring both their potential and the regulatory challenges of supporting large-scale LDES.

Most VIF methods focus primarily on optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation, making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions, we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves superior crowd counting performance.

In plasticity, these models often rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases, temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.

The emulator accurately reproduces the thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H, H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10% in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method, where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time. This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.

Capturing the spatial patterns of their distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions. Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of 96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones indicating potential conflict.

We develop a cube packing engine which can simultaneously optimize physical and architectural design for effective utilization of 3D in terms of performance, area and temperature. Our experimental results using a design driver show 36% performance improvement (in BIPS) over 2D and 14% over 3D with single layer blocks. Additionally multi-layer blocks can provide up to 30% reduction in power dissipation compared to the single-layer alternatives.

However, a major challenge that remains is the generalization of machine learning models across individuals, given the high cross-participant variability inherent to EEG signals and the limited focus on direct pain perception identification in current research. In this study, we systematically evaluate the performance of cross-participant generalization of a wide range of models, including traditional classifiers and deep neural classifiers for identifying the sensory modality of thermal pain and aversive auditory stimulation from EEG recordings. Using a novel dataset of EEG recordings from 108 participants, we benchmark model performance under both within- and cross-participant evaluation settings. Our findings show that traditional models suffered the largest drop from within- to cross-participant performance, while deep learning models proved more resilient, underscoring their potential for subject-invariant EEG decoding. Even though performance variability remained high, the strong results of the graph-based model highlight its potential to capture subject-invariant structure in EEG signals. On the other hand, we also share the preprocessed dataset used in this study, providing a standardized benchmark for evaluating future algorithms under the same generalization constraints.

Given the nonlinear, multivariate structure of UTCI, we investigate symbolic and sparse regression techniques as tools for interpretable and efficient function approximation. In particular, we highlight the benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre polynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in stability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly lower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial benchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, we construct models that efficiently populate a Pareto front of accuracy versus complexity and exhibit stable, hierarchical coefficient structures across varying model capacities. Training on just 20% of the data, our models generalize robustly to the remaining 80%, with consistent performance under bootstrapping. The decomposition effectively approximates the UTCI as a Fourier-like expansion in an orthogonal basis, yielding results near the theoretical optimum in the L2 (least squares) sense. We also connect these findings to the broader context of equation discovery in environmental modeling, referencing probabilistic grammar-based methods that enforce domain consistency and compactness in symbolic expressions. Taken together, these results illustrate how combining sparsity, orthogonality, and symbolic structure enables robust, interpretable modeling of complex environmental indices like UTCI - and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approximation in both accuracy and efficiency.

Unlike standard approaches that assume sigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions (limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses Gaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model any melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through kernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing proteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability, such as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses, where conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to their statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing proteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating proteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal thermal stability behaviors. Thermal Tracks is freely available from GitHub and is implemented in Python, providing an accessible and flexible tool for proteome-wide thermal profiling studies.

We propose solving this numerically using the optimized Schwarz method (OSM), which decouples the heterogeneous problem into homogeneous subproblems. This avoids ill-conditioned systems from monolithic solving due to high contrast and interface jumps. Both energy estimate and Fourier analysis are used to prove the convergence of this algorithm when the standard Robin condition is applied to transmit information between subdomains. To achieve fast convergence, instead of the standard Robin, the scaled Robin transmission condition is proposed, and the involved free parameter is rigorously optimized. The results reveal several new findings due to the presence of TCR: first, the larger the TCR, the faster the OSM converges; second, mesh-independent convergence is achieved in the asymptotic sense, in contrast to the mesh-dependent results without TCR; and last, the heterogeneity contrast benefits the convergence, with a larger contrast leading to faster convergence. Interestingly, different from the case without TCR, the thermal conductivity also benefits the convergence, similar to the effect of heterogeneity. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's potential for nonlinear problems on irregular domains.

Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity implications of domestic energy policy.

However, TIR images typically suffer from heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic deployment.

The heat equation is interpreted as a static one containing time- and frequency-dependent nonhomogeneous source terms, which is similar to eigen-fields but is transformed into a boundary integral by the dual-reciprocity method. Using the steady-state bimaterial Green's function, boundary integral equations are proposed to take into account continuity conditions of temperature and heat flux, which avoids setting up any continuity equations at the bimaterial interface. Eigen-temperature-gradients and eigen-heat-source are introduced to simulate the material mismatch in thermal conductivity and heat capacity, respectively. The DR-iBEM algorithm is particularly suitable for investigating the transient and harmonic thermal behaviors of bi-layered composites and is verified by the finite element method (FEM). Numerical comparison with the FEM demonstrates its robustness and accuracy. The method has been applied to a functionally graded material as a bimaterial with graded particle distributions, where particle size and gradation effects are evaluated.

Building on our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Multimodality enables the integration of complementary information collected by different sensors. However, this information must be processed by machine learning algorithms specifically designed to leverage heterogeneous data. Furthermore, it is necessary to identify which sensor modalities are most informative for navigation in the target environment. In Martian exploration, thermal imagery has proven valuable for assessing terrain safety due to differences in thermal behaviour between soil types. This work presents OmniUnet, a transformer-based neural network architecture for semantic segmentation using RGB, depth, and thermal (RGB-D-T) imagery. A custom multimodal sensor housing was developed using 3D printing and mounted on the Martian Rover Testbed for Autonomy (MaRTA) to collect a multimodal dataset in the Bardenas semi-desert in northern Spain. This location serves as a representative environment of the Martian surface, featuring terrain types such as sand, bedrock, and compact soil. A subset of this dataset was manually labeled to support supervised training of the network. The model was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving a pixel accuracy of 80.37% and demonstrating strong performance in segmenting complex unstructured terrain. Inference tests yielded an average prediction time of 673 ms on a resource-constrained computer (Jetson Orin Nano), confirming its suitability for on-robot deployment. The software implementation of the network and the labeled dataset have been made publicly available to support future research in multimodal terrain perception for planetary robotics.

Many existing methods focus on monitoring only the respiratory rate, while others focus on monitoring the motion of the chest as a patient breathes, which is referred to as the respiratory waveform. This paper presents WiRM, a two-staged approach to contactless respiration monitoring. In the first stage, WiRM improves upon existing respiratory rate estimation techniques by using conjugate multiplication for phase sanitisation and adaptive multi-trace carving (AMTC) for tracing how the respiratory rate changes over time. When compared against three state-of-the-art methods, WiRM has achieved an average reduction of $38\%$ in respiratory rate root mean squared error (RMSE). In the second stage, WiRM uses this improved respiratory rate estimate to inform the decomposition and selection of the respiratory waveform from the CSI data. Remarkably, WiRM delivers a $178.3\%$ improvement in average absolute correlation with the ground truth respiratory waveform. Within the literature, it is difficult to compare the robustness of existing algorithms in noisy environments. In this paper, we develop a purpose-built simulation toolkit to evaluate the robustness of respiration monitoring solutions under various noise conditions, including thermal, multiplicative, and phase noise. Our results show that WiRM demonstrates improved or comparable resilience to these common noise sources.

However, extracting multiple parameters from FDTR measurements presents a nonlinear inverse problem due to its high dimensionality and multimodal, non-convex solution space. This study evaluates four popular global optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Fireworks Algorithm (FWA), for extracting parameters from FDTR measurements of a GaN/Si heterostructure. However, none achieve reliable convergence within 60 seconds. To improve convergence speed and accuracy, we propose an AI-driven hybrid optimization framework that combines each global algorithm with a Quasi-Newton local refinement method, resulting in four hybrid variants: HGA, HQGA, HPSO, and HFWA. Among these, HPSO outperforms all other methods, with 80% of trials reaching the target fitness value within 60 seconds, showing greater robustness and a lower risk of premature convergence. In contrast, only 30% of HGA and HQGA trials and 20% of HFWA trials achieve this threshold. We then evaluate the worst-case performance across 100 independent trials for each algorithm when the time is extended to 1000 seconds. Only HPSO, PSO, and HGA consistently reach the target accuracy, with HPSO converging five times faster than the others. HPSO provides a general-purpose solution for inverse problems in thermal metrology and can be readily extended to other model-fitting techniques.

In response to the 2025 VIP Cup challenge tasks - drone detection, tracking, and payload identification - we propose a dual-stream drone monitoring framework. Our approach deploys independent You Only Look Once v11-nano (YOLOv11n) object detectors on parallel infrared (thermal) and visible (RGB) data streams, deliberately avoiding early fusion. This separation allows each model to be specifically optimized for the distinct characteristics of its input modality, addressing the unique challenges posed by small aerial objects in diverse environmental conditions. We customize data preprocessing and augmentation strategies per domain - such as limiting color jitter for IR imagery - and fine-tune training hyperparameters to enhance detection performance under conditions of heavy noise, low light, and motion blur. The resulting lightweight YOLOv11n models demonstrate high accuracy in distinguishing drones from birds and in classifying payload types, all while maintaining real-time performance. This report details the rationale for a dual-modality design, the specialized training pipelines, and the architectural optimizations that collectively enable efficient and accurate drone surveillance across RGB and IR channels.

The approach is based on the definition of compatible discrete curl-grad operators, exploiting the triangular nature of the dual mesh. We design a cell solver reminiscent of the nodal solvers used in Lagrangian schemes to discretize the evolution equation for the thermal impulse vector, and we demonstrate that the resulting numerical scheme ensures energy conservation, local non-negative entropy production, as well as asymptotic consistency with the classical Fourier law in the stiff relaxation limit. A novel technique is proposed to transfer residuals from the dual to the primal mesh as subfluxes, which eventually yields the construction of entropy compatible semi-discrete methods. The scheme and its properties are validated on a set of numerical test cases.

A lightweight semantic segmentation model based on SegFormer is developed, featuring a customised Transformwer encoder and streamlined decoder, and fine-tuned on annotated images with manually labeled defect regions. To evaluate performance, we benchmark our model against U-Net, DeepLabV3, PSPNet, and Mask2Former using consistent preprocessing and augmentation.

Beyond biomass-based solutions, solar thermal energy, with or without heat pumps, presents a significant opportunity. However, system performance is highly dependent on outdoor and setpoint temperatures. This study aims to optimize system design using a multi-criteria approach that considers techno-economic and environmental (CO2) factors. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed, incorporating temperature discretization for problem linearization and capturing key dynamic characteristics of heat generators. The model improves convergence, reducing a 19% MIP gap in 26 hours to 10% in 12 hours by dissipating 6% excess solar heat. A multi-scenario analysis under two carbon taxation levels and different CO2 emission cases revealed solar integration up to 11,932 m${}^2$ but increased gas reliance (50%) and TES losses (49%). Wood boiler inclusion reduced solar dependency, covering 45% of heat, lowered LCOH, but limited renewable penetration. Higher carbon taxes boosted solar adoption but faced storage inefficiencies, while biomass enhanced cost efficiency and system stability.

The STARFAB project aims to create a ground demonstration of an orbital automated warehouse as a hub for sustainable commercial operations and servicing. A critical part of this fully-autonomous robotic facility will be the capability to monitor, inspect, and assess the condition of both the components stored in the warehouse, and the STARFAB facility itself. This paper introduces ongoing work on the STARFAB Mobile Inspection Module (MIM). The MIM uses Standard Interconnects (SI) so that it can be carried by Walking Manipulators (WM) as an independently-mobile robot, and multiple MIMs can be stored and retrieved as needed for operations on STARFAB. The MIM carries high-resolution cameras, a 3D profilometer, and a thermal imaging sensor, with the capability to add other modular sensors. A grasping tool and torque wrench are stored within the modular body for use by an attached WM for maintenance operations. Implementation and testing is still ongoing at the time of writing. This paper details the concept of operations for the MIM as an on-orbit autonomous inspection and maintenance system, the mechanical and electronic design of the MIM, and the sensors package used for non-destructive testing.

As a generalization of quantum thermalization, it is often associated with high complexity and entanglement. Here, we introduce computational deep thermalization and construct the fastest possible dynamics exhibiting it at infinite effective temperature. Our circuit dynamics produce quantum states with low entanglement in polylogarithmic depth that are indistinguishable from Haar random states to any computationally bounded observer. Importantly, the observer is allowed to request many copies of the same residual state obtained from partial projective measurements on the state -- this condition is beyond the standard settings of quantum pseudorandomness, but natural for deep thermalization. In cryptographic terms, these states are pseudorandom, pseudoentangled, and crucially, retain these properties under local measurements. Our results demonstrate a new form of computational thermalization, where thermal-like behavior arises from structured quantum states endowed with cryptographic properties, instead of from highly unstructured ensembles. The low resource complexity of preparing these states suggests scalable simulations of deep thermalization using quantum computers. Our work also motivates the study of computational quantum pseudorandomness beyond BQP observers.

However, these parts are prone to internal defects and geometric inaccuracies, stemming in part from variations in the melt pool. This paper proposes a novel vector-level feedforward control framework for regulating melt pool area in LPBF. By decoupling part-scale thermal behavior from small-scale melt pool physics, the controller provides a scale-agnostic prediction of melt pool area and efficient optimization over it. This is done by operating on two coupled lightweight models: a finite-difference thermal model that efficiently captures vector-level temperature fields and a reduced-order, analytical melt pool model. Each model is calibrated separately with minimal single-track and 2D experiments, and the framework is validated on a complex 3D geometry in both Inconel 718 and 316L stainless steel. Results showed that feedforward vector-level laser power scheduling reduced geometric inaccuracy in key dimensions by 62%, overall porosity by 16.5%, and photodiode variation by 6.8% on average. Overall, this modular, data-efficient approach demonstrates that proactively compensating for known thermal effects can significantly improve part quality while remaining computationally efficient and readily extensible to other materials and machines.

Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather, temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly, contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector, called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing protocols.

However, the complex thermal dynamics inherent to the process present challenges in ensuring structural integrity and mechanical properties of fabricated thick walls and plates. While finite element method (FEM) simulations have been conventionally employed to predict thermal history during deposition, their computational demand remains prohibitively high for actual large-scale applications. Given the necessity of multiple repetitive simulations for heat management and the determination of an optimal printing strategy, FEM simulation quickly becomes entirely infeasible. Instead, advancements have been made in using trained neural networks as surrogate models for rapid prediction. However, traditional data-driven approaches necessitate large amounts of relevant and verifiable external data, during the training and validation of the neural network. Regarding large-scale wire-arc DED, none of these data sources are readily available in quantities sufficient for an accurate surrogate. The introduction of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has opened up an alternative simulation strategy by leveraging the existing physical knowledge of the phenomena with advanced machine learning methods. Despite their theoretical advantages, PINNs have seen limited application in the context of large-scale wire-arc DED for structural engineering. This study investigates the scalability of PINNs, focusing on efficient collocation points sampling, a critical factor controlling both the training time and model performance. Results show PINNs can reduce computational time and effort by up to 98.6%, while maintaining the desired accuracy and offering "super-resolution". Future directions for enhancing PINN performance in metal AM are discussed.

We conducted eleven simulations, varying the peak linear heat generation rates. Of these, eight were used for training, two for validation, and one for testing.
  The CNN was trained for over 1,000 epochs without signs of overfitting, achieving highly accurate temperature distribution predictions. These were then used in a thermomechanical model to determine the stress and strain distribution within the fuel rod.

While computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can model heat transfer with high fidelity, their cost prohibits real-time application such as model-based temperature control. To address this, we generate a CNN-based surrogate model that can predict the Nusselt distribution in real time. We train it with data from implicit large eddy computational fluid dynamics simulations (Re < 2,000). We train two distinct models, one for a five by one array of jets (83 simulations) and one for a three by three array of jets (100 simulations). We introduce a method to extrapolate predictions to higher Reynolds numbers (Re < 10,000) using a correlation-based scaling. The surrogate models achieve high accuracy, with a normalized mean average error below 2% on validation data for the five by one surrogate model and 0.6% for the three by three surrogate model. Experimental validation confirms the model's predictive capabilities. This work provides a foundation for model-based control strategies in advanced thermal management applications.

This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However, continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30 activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9 countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3% of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments, and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and health-risk behaviors in real time.

Precise and prompt detection is a key factor in proper treatment and better patient outcomes. Traditional methods for detecting brain tumors, that include biopsies, MRI, and CT scans often face challenges due to their high costs and the need for specialized medical expertise. Recent developments in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has exhibited strong capabilities in automating the identification and categorization of brain tumors from medical images, especially MRI scans. However, these classical ML models have limitations, such as high computational demands, the need for large datasets, and long training times, which hinder their accessibility and efficiency. Our research uses MobileNET model for efficient detection of these tumors. The novelty of this project lies in building an accurate tumor detection model which use less computing re-sources and runs in less time followed by efficient decision making through the use of image processing technique for accurate results. The suggested method attained an average accuracy of 98.5%.

While robots have shown promise in assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11, and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for future research in this critical safety application.

PULSE-A's low-cost open-source bus serves as the backbone of the mission and has been designed in tandem with the Payload, with design driven by strict requirements for pointing accuracy, component alignment, power demand, and thermal stability. This work presents the design and testing of the PULSE-A bus.
  The spacecraft bus was designed to fill two major needs: (1) to meet the requirements of the PULSE-A mission, and (2) to be easily configurable for future missions that desire enhanced capabilities over other low-cost open-source designs. At its core, the bus features dual BeagleBone Black Industrial compute units, selected for their flight heritage, integrated via a PC/104 header standard. PULSE-A implements Goddard Space Flight Center's core Flight System (cFS), which takes a modular software architecture approach and is built in C. The use of C as the primary language aligns with the expertise of the University of Chicago's Computer Science department, allowing for ease of development by PULSE-A's undergraduate flight software team.
  The CubeSat structure utilizes Gran Systems' 3U frame, modified to accommodate openings for various ports and deployable components. Inside, the avionics stack uses the PC/104 standard quad rails, which terminate in PULSE-A's custom-designed Payload Box that houses all of the Payload components and optical fiber runs. This work also covers the techniques and iterative engineering processes used to develop the thermal control and dissipation mechanisms for the specific requirements, under volume, mass, and temperature-range constraints.

Our approach follows the differentiable programming paradigm by learning an explicit neural policy that maps control parameters to integer- and continuous-valued decision variables. This policy is optimized via stochastic gradient descent by differentiating the quadratic model predictive control objective through the closed-loop finite-horizon response of the system dynamics. To handle integrality constraints, we incorporate three differentiable rounding strategies. The approach is evaluated on a conceptual thermal energy system, comparing its performance with the optimal solution for different lengths of the prediction horizon. The simulation results indicate that our self-supervised learning approach can achieve near-optimal control performance while significantly reducing inference time by avoiding online optimization, thus implying its potential for embedded deployment even on edge devices.

To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces effective feature representations that support more accurate target localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed. Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second. This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features, pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and 15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%), significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability, low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding processes.

Among the main contributors, the building sector stands out due to its significant energy demand. Addressing this challenge requires innovative techniques in the control of energy systems in buildings. This paper deals with the formulation of a methodology designed to evaluate the performance of these controllers. The evaluation process involves the establishment of a comprehensive test protocol and a diverse set of scenarios to evaluate the controllers. Key performance indicators are used to quantify their effectiveness based on the test results. A practical case study is presented as an application to introduce this methodology, focusing on the integration of Model Predictive Controllers (MPCs) with the Dimosim thermal simulation platform. The digital twin of the Greener building in Grenoble is used as a model for emulation. The paper demonstrates the ability of the proposed methodology to test and rank MPCs in different test scenarios, providing valuable feedback on their performance capabilities. The paper highlights the importance of the developed approach in systematically evaluating and ranking MPCs for optimized building energy management.

However, tuning these settings does not achieve optimal energy savings. We highlight how existing power capping mechanisms can address these limitations without requiring any changes to current power governors. We validate this approach using system measurements across a month-long data acquisition campaign from SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks on a server-class system equipped with dual Intel Xeon Scalable processors. Our results indicate that setting a simple power cap can improve energy efficiency by up to 25% over traditional energy-saving system configurations with little performance loss, as most default settings focus on thermal regulation and performance rather than compute efficiency. Power capping is very accessible compared to other approaches, as it can be implemented with a single Linux command. Our results point to programmers and administrators using power caps as a primary mechanism to maintain significant energy efficiency while retaining acceptable performance, as opposed to deploying complex DVFS algorithms.

Mathematically, these properties are modeled as symmetric positive definite (SPD) tensors, which reside on a curved Riemannian manifold. Extending this description to a stochastic framework requires preserving both the SPD structure and the underlying spatial symmetries of the tensors. This is achieved through the spectral decomposition of tensors, which enables the parameterization of uncertainties into scale (strength) and rotation (orientation) components. To quantify the impact of strength and orientation uncertainties on the thermal behaviour of the composite, the stochastic material tensor must be propagated through a physics-based forward model. This process necessitates computationally efficient surrogate models, for which a feedforward neural network (FNN) is employed. However, conventional FNN architectures are not well-suited for SPD tensors, as directly using tensor components as input features fails to preserve their underlying geometric structure, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce the Constitutive Manifold Neural Network (CMNN), which incorporates input layers that map SPD tensors from the curved manifold to the local tangent space-a flat vector space-thus preserving the statistical and geometric information in the dataset. A case study involving steady-state heat conduction with stochastic anisotropic conductivity demonstrates that geometry-preserving neural network significantly enhances learning performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). These findings underscore the importance of manifold-aware methods when working with tensor-valued data in engineering applications.

To address these challenges, we propose a feature fusion and knowledge-distilled framework for multi-modal MTD that leverages data fusion to enhance accuracy and employs knowledge distillation for improved domain adaptation. Specifically, our approach utilizes both RGB and thermal image inputs within a novel fusion-based multi-modal model, coupled with a distillation training pipeline. We formulate the problem as a posterior probability optimization task, which is solved through a multi-stage training pipeline supported by a composite loss function. This loss function effectively transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. Experimental results demonstrate that our student model achieves approximately 95% of the teacher model's mean Average Precision while reducing inference time by approximately 50%, underscoring its suitability for practical MTD deployment scenarios.

Efficiency is lost through wasted energy during locomotion and standing. Including elastic elements has been shown to reduce movement costs, while including breaks can reduce standing costs. However, adding separate elements for each increases the mass and complexity of a leg, reducing overall system performance. Here we present a novel compliant mechanism using a Handed Shearing Auxetic (HSA) that acts as a spring and break in a monopod hopping robot. The HSA acts as a parallel elastic actuator, reducing electrical power for dynamic hopping and matching the efficiency of state-of-the-art compliant hoppers. The HSA\u2019s auxetic behavior enables dual functionality. During static tasks, it locks under large forces with minimal input power by blocking deformation, creating high friction similar to a capstan mechanism. This allows the leg to support heavy loads without motor torque, addressing thermal inefficiency. The multi-functional design enhances both dynamic and static performance, offering a versatile solution for robotic applications.

The PIROM architecture integrates a reduced-physics backbone, based on the lumped-capacitance model (LCM), with data-driven correction dynamics formulated via a coarse-graining approach rooted in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. While the LCM captures the dominant heat transfer mechanisms, the correction terms compensate for residual dynamics arising from higher-order non-linear interactions and heterogeneities across material layers. The proposed PIROM is benchmarked against two non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs): Operator Inference (OpInf) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). The PIROM consistently achieves errors below 1% for a wide range of extrapolative settings involving time- and space-dependent boundary conditions and temperature-varying material property perturbations. In contrast, OpInf exhibits moderate degradation, and NODE suffers substantial loss in accuracy due to its lack of embedded physics. Despite higher training costs, PIROM delivers online evaluations of two orders of magnitude faster than the full-order model. These results demonstrate that PIROM effectively reconciles the trade-offs between accuracy, generalizability, and efficiency, providing a robust framework for thermal modeling of TPS under diverse operating conditions.

However, the very nature of thermally induced mechanical actuation sets inherent operation constraints: unidirectional motion, environmental sensitivity, and slow response times limited by passive cooling. To overcome these constraints, we propose a meta-actuator architecture, which uses engineered heat transfer in thin films to achieve multifunctional operation. We demonstrate electrically selectable bidirectional motion with large deflection ($ \geq $28% of actuator length at 0.75 W), suppressed thermal sensitivity to ambient temperature changes when compared to conventional actuators (>100$ \times $ lower), and actively forced return to the rest state, which is 10 times faster than that with passive cooling. We further show that our meta-actuator approach enables extended ranges of motions for manipulating complex objects. Versatile soft gripper operations highlight the meta-actuator's potential for soft robotics and devices.

Embedded non-volatile memories (eNVMs) address these requirements by offering faster access to stored data at an improved computational throughput and efficiency. Furthermore, these technologies offer numerous appealing features, including limited area-energy-runtime budget and data retention capabilities. Among these, the data retention feature of eNVMs has garnered particular interest within the semiconductor community. Although this property allows eNVMs to retain data even in the absence of a continuous power supply, it also introduces some vulnerabilities, prompting security concerns. These concerns have sparked increased interest in examining the broader security implications associated with eNVM technologies. This paper examines the security aspects of eNVMs by discussing the reasons for vulnerabilities in specific memories from an architectural point of view. Additionally, this paper extensively reviews eNVM-based security primitives, such as physically unclonable functions and true random number generators, as well as techniques like logic obfuscation. The paper also explores a broad spectrum of security threats to eNVMs, including physical attacks such as side-channel attacks, fault injection, and probing, as well as logical threats like information leakage, denial-of-service, and thermal attacks.

Atomic modeling using the path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method can fully account for such effects, but requires computationally efficient and accurate models of interatomic interactions. Empirical potentials are fast but may lack sufficient accuracy, whereas quantum-mechanical calculations are highly accurate but computationally expensive. Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer a solution to this challenge, providing near-quantum-mechanical accuracy while maintaining high computational efficiency compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In this context, an interface was developed to integrate moment tensor potentials (MTPs) from the MLIP-2 software package into PIMD calculations using the i-PI software package. This interface was then applied to active learning of potentials and to investigate the influence of NQEs on material properties, namely the temperature dependence of lattice parameters and thermal expansion coefficients, as well as radial distribution functions, for lithium hydride (LiH) and silicon (Si) systems. The results were compared with experimental data, quasi-harmonic approximation calculations, and predictions from the universal machine learning force field MatterSim. These comparisons demonstrated the high accuracy and effectiveness of the MTP-PIMD approach.

However, many non-wearable assistive devices have struggled to replicate natural motion trajectories. While wearable devices offer better coordination with the human body, they present challenges in completely isolating mechanical and electrical hazards. To address this, we developed a novel standing-assist robot that integrates features of both wearable and non-wearable systems, aiming to achieve high coordination while maintaining safety. The device employs a four-link mechanism aligned with the human joint structure, designed to reproduce the S-shaped trajectory of the hip and the arc trajectory of the knee during natural standing-up motion. Subject-specific trajectory data were obtained using a gyroscope, and the link lengths were determined to drive the seat along the optimal path. A feedforward speed control using a stepping motor was implemented, and the reproducibility of the trajectory was evaluated based on the geometric constraints of the mechanism. A load-bearing experiment with weights fixed to the seat was conducted to assess the trajectory accuracy under different conditions. Results showed that the reproduction errors for the hip and knee trajectories remained within approximately 4 percent of the seat's total displacement, demonstrating high fidelity to the target paths. In addition, durability testing, thermal safety evaluation, and risk assessment confirmed the reliability and safety of the system for indoor use. These findings suggest that the proposed design offers a promising approach for developing assistive technologies that adapt to individual physical characteristics, with potential applications in elderly care and rehabilitation.

Therefore, high-fidelity simulations (HFS) are employed during the design process, as they enable a detailed analysis of the thermal and structural behavior of the system. However, such simulations are both computationally expensive and tedious, particularly during iterative optimization procedures. Establishing a parametric reduced order model (pROM) can accelerate the design's optimization if the model can accurately predict the behavior over a wide range of material and geometric properties. However, many existing methods exhibit limitations when applied to wide design ranges.
  In this work, we introduce the parametric Box Reduction (pBR) method, a matrix interpolation technique that minimizes the non-physical influence of training points due to the large parameter ranges. For this purpose, we define a new interpolation function that computes a local weight for each design variable and integrates them into the global function. Furthermore, we develop an intuitive clustering technique to select the training points for the model, avoiding numerical artifacts from distant points. Additionally, these two strategies do not require normalizing the parameter space and handle every property equally. The effectiveness of the pBR method is validated through two physical applications: structural deformation of a cantilever Timoshenko beam and heat transfer of a power module of a power converter. The results demonstrate that the pBR approach can accurately capture the behavior of mechatronic components across large parameter ranges without sacrificing computational efficiency.

The advancements in object detection methods utilizing TIR images have sparked significant research interest. However, most traditional methods lack the capability to effectively extract and fuse local-global information, which is crucial for TIR-domain feature attention. In this study, we present a novel and efficient thermal infrared object detection framework, known as CRT-YOLO, that is based on centralized feature regulation, enabling the establishment of global-range interaction on TIR information. Our proposed model integrates efficient multi-scale attention (EMA) modules, which adeptly capture long-range dependencies while incurring minimal computational overhead. Additionally, it leverages the Centralized Feature Pyramid (CFP) network, which offers global regulation of TIR features. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CRT-YOLO model significantly outperforms conventional methods for TIR image object detection. Furthermore, the ablation study provides compelling evidence of the effectiveness of our proposed modules, reinforcing the potential impact of our approach on advancing the field of thermal infrared object detection.

However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous datasets with intrinsic disparities. In this paper, we extend zentropy theory into the data science domain by introducing intrinsic entropy, enabling more effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. We propose a zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN) that simultaneously learns both energy and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of multi-source data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives. As a practical application, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy landscape of Fe3Pt using data generated from DFT and capture key material behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the temperature-pressure space. Overall, our study introduces a novel approach for data-driven machine learning grounded in zentropy theory, highlighting ZENN as a versatile and robust deep learning framework for scientific problems involving complex, heterogeneous datasets.

The autoencoder is trained on thermal images captured from a commercial power module at randomly varied load currents and augmented image2 generated through image processing techniques such as resizing, rotation, perspective transformation, and bright and contrast adjustment. Since the autoencoder is trained to output images identical to input only for normal samples, it reconstructs images similar to normal ones even when the input images containing faults. A small heater is attached to the circuit board to simulate a fault on a power module, and then thermal images were captured from different angles and positions, as well as various load currents to test the trained autoencoder model. The areas under the curve (AUC) were obtained to evaluate the proposed method. The results show the autoencoder model can detect anomalies with 100% accuracy under given conditions. The influence of hyperparameters such as the number of convolutional layers and image augmentation conditions on anomaly detection accuracy was also investigated.

In particular, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for thermal image segmentation can be an efficient solution to address the lack of labeled thermal datasets. Nevertheless, since these methods do not effectively utilize the complementary information between RGB and thermal images, they significantly decrease performance during domain adaptation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on cross-spectral UDA for thermal image semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel masked mutual learning strategy that promotes complementary information exchange by selectively transferring results between each spectral model while masking out uncertain regions. Additionally, we introduce a novel prototypical self-supervised loss designed to enhance the performance of the thermal segmentation model in nighttime scenarios. This approach addresses the limitations of RGB pre-trained networks, which cannot effectively transfer knowledge under low illumination due to the inherent constraints of RGB sensors. In experiments, our method achieves higher performance over previous UDA methods and comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

In order to test the inverse model, a synthetic dataset is created by running the model in forward mode with known parameter values to create soil temperature time series that can be used as observations for the inverse model. We show that it is not possible to obtain a reliable parameter estimation using a single observed soil temperature time series. Using measurements at two depths, reliable parameter estimates can be obtained although it is not possible to differentiate between latent and sensible heat fluxes. We apply the inverse model to urban flux tower data in Phoenix, United States, and show that the thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and the combined sensible-latent heat transfer coefficient can be reliably estimated using an observed value for the effective surface albedo. The resulting model accurately predicts the outgoing longwave radiation, conductive soil fluxes and the combined sensible-latent heat fluxes.

However, SAM is trained solely on RGB data, limiting its direct applicability to RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation. Given that RGB-T provides a robust solution for scene understanding in adverse weather and lighting conditions, such as low light and overexposure, we propose a novel framework, SARTM, which customizes the powerful SAM for RGB-T semantic segmentation. Our key idea is to unleash the potential of SAM while introduce semantic understanding modules for RGB-T data pairs. Specifically, our framework first involves fine tuning the original SAM by adding extra LoRA layers, aiming at preserving SAM's strong generalization and segmentation capabilities for downstream tasks. Secondly, we introduce language information as guidance for training our SARTM. To address cross-modal inconsistencies, we introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation(CMKD) module that effectively achieves modality adaptation while maintaining its generalization capabilities. This semantic module enables the minimization of modality gaps and alleviates semantic ambiguity, facilitating the combination of any modality under any visual conditions. Furthermore, we enhance the segmentation performance by adjusting the segmentation head of SAM and incorporating an auxiliary semantic segmentation head, which integrates multi-scale features for effective fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted across three multi-modal RGBT semantic segmentation benchmarks: MFNET, PST900, and FMB. Both quantitative and qualitative results consistently demonstrate that the proposed SARTM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across a variety of conditions.

The objective is to determine if this dual approach can reveal information leaks in non-equilibrium KLJN systems. Results indicate that the duality method successfully detects information leaks, further supporting the necessity of thermal equilibrium for unconditional security in KLJN systems. Our findings confirm that the duality method successfully detects information leaks, with results closely mirroring those of Chamon and Kish, showing comparable vulnerabilities in non-equilibrium conditions. These results further support the necessity of thermal equilibrium for unconditional security in the KLJN scheme.

Conventional thermal comfort models, such as the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), rely on both environmental and personal variables. However, the use of fixed-location sensors limits the ability to capture spatial variability, which reduces the accuracy of occupant-specific comfort estimation. To address this limitation, this study proposes a new PMV estimation method that incorporates spatial environmental data reconstructed using the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm. In addition, a group PMV-based control framework is developed to account for the thermal comfort of multiple occupants. The Gappy POD method enables fast and accurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields from sparse sensor measurements. Using these reconstructed fields and occupant location data, spatially resolved PMV values are calculated. Group-level thermal conditions are then derived through statistical aggregation methods and used to control indoor temperature in a multi-occupant living lab environment. Experimental results show that the Gappy POD algorithm achieves an average relative error below 3\% in temperature reconstruction. PMV distributions varied by up to 1.26 scale units depending on occupant location. Moreover, thermal satisfaction outcomes varied depending on the group PMV method employed. These findings underscore the importance for adaptive thermal control strategies that incorporate both spatial and individual variability, offering valuable insights for future occupant-centric building operations.

The results are verified through benchmark problems of heat transfer. Finally, we analyse the insulating capabilities of superelastic polyimide by simulating the thermal response of an aluminium plate. The result shows a considerable reduction in the thermal stress, strain and temperature field development in the aluminium plate when superelastic polyimide is used as an insulator. The present work demonstrates the effectiveness of the multi-scale method in capturing thermo-mechanical interactions in superelastic polyimide.

We demonstrate that pre-shared entanglement using two-mode squeezed vacuum states significantly reduces detection latency compared to classical and entanglement-augmented coherent-state probes. The change detection latency is inversely proportional to the quantum relative entropy (QRE), which goes to infinity in the absence of thermal noise, suggesting idealized instantaneous detection. However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal noise mean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and quantify its performance gains over existing methods. Additionally, we explore the fundamental trade-off between communication capacity and change detection latency, highlighting how pre-shared entanglement enhances both.

This is compounded by certain behavioral practices like retention of older, less efficient appliances, resulting in missed energy savings. Thus, the need to enhance efficiency becomes critical in these households. However, due to a lack of comprehensive data in India, little is understood about their electricity consumption patterns and usage efficiency. Estimating inefficiency and assessing its determinants is crucial for improving their quality of life. This study measures the inefficiency in electricity consumption due to household practices and appliances in social housing in Mumbai, India. It considers technological determinants in addition to socio-economic variables. The study employs primary data collected from rehabilitation housing and slums in Mumbai. Stochastic frontier analysis, a parametric approach, is applied to estimate indicators of electricity consumption and inefficiency. While household size and workforce participation significantly affect consumption behavior in rehabilitation housing, it is limited to the workforce in slums. The ownership of appliances, except for washing machines in slums, also exhibits considerable impacts. The mean efficiency scores of 83% and 91% for rehabilitation housing and slums, respectively, empirically quantify the potential savings achievable. Factors that positively influence inefficiency include the duration of operating refrigerators, washing machines, iron, and AC. These results hold implications for enhancing the uptake of efficient appliances in addition to accelerating energy efficiency retrofits in the region. Policies should focus on awareness and the development of appliance markets through incentives.

They provide several key advantages such as providing shade for energy conservation, and intercepting rainfall to reduce flood runoff and soil erosion. Traditional approaches for monitoring the health of urban forests require instrumented inspection techniques, often involving a high amount of human labor and subjective evaluations. As a result, they are not scalable for cities which lack extensive resources. Recent approaches involving multi-spectral imaging data based on terrestrial sensing and satellites, are constrained respectively with challenges related to dedicated deployments and limited spatial resolutions. In this work, we propose an alternative approach for monitoring the urban forests using simplified inputs: street view imagery, tree inventory data and meteorological conditions. We propose to use image-to-image translation networks to estimate two urban forest health parameters, namely, NDVI and CTD. Finally, we aim to compare the generated results with ground truth data using an onsite campaign utilizing handheld multi-spectral and thermal imaging sensors. With the advent and expansion of street view imagery platforms such as Google Street View and Mapillary, this approach should enable effective management of urban forests for the authorities in cities at scale.

Neural network-based thermal prediction models can perform real-time predictions for many unseen new designs. However, existing CNN-based and GCN-based methods cannot effectively capture the global thermal features, especially for high-frequency components, hindering prediction accuracy enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-spatial dual domain aware prediction network (FSA-Heat) for fast and high-accuracy thermal prediction in 2.5D ICs. It integrates high-to-low frequency and spatial domain encoder (FSTE) module with frequency domain cross-scale interaction module (FCIFormer) to achieve high-to-low frequency and global-to-local thermal dissipation feature extraction. Additionally, a frequency-spatial hybrid loss (FSL) is designed to effectively attenuate high-frequency thermal gradient noise and spatial misalignments. The experimental results show that the performance enhancements offered by our proposed method are substantial, outperforming the newly-proposed 2.5D method, GCN+PNA, by considerable margins (over 99% RMSE reduction, 4.23X inference time speedup). Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that FSA-Heat also exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

To counter this, we propose an adaptive real-time monitoring mechanism that detects abnormal thermal patterns in chip tiles. Our design space exploration helped identify key thermal features for an efficient anomaly detection module to be implemented at routers of network-enabled MPSoCs. To minimize hardware overhead, we employ weighted moving average (WMA) calculations and bit-shift operations, ensuring a lightweight yet effective implementation. By defining a spectrum of abnormal behaviors, our system successfully detects and mitigates malicious temperature fluctuations, reducing severe cases from 3.00Â°C to 1.9Â°C. The anomaly detection module achieves up to 82% of accuracy in detecting thermal attacks, which is only 10-15% less than top-performing machine learning (ML) models like Random Forest. However, our approach reduces hardware usage by up to 75% for logic resources and 100% for specialized resources, making it significantly more efficient than ML-based solutions. This method provides a practical, low-cost solution for resource-constrained environments, ensuring resilience against thermal attacks while maintaining system performance.

Previous work shows that an environment's color temperature affects the experienced temperature. As virtual reality (VR) enables visual immersion, recent work suggests that a VR scene's color temperature also affects experienced temperature. In addition, virtual avatars representing thermal cues influence users' thermal perception and even the body temperature. As immersive technology becomes increasingly prevalent in daily life, leveraging thermal cues to enhance thermal comfort - without relying on actual thermal energy - presents a promising opportunity. Understanding these effects is crucial for optimizing virtual experiences and promoting sustainable energy practices. Therefore, we propose three controlled experiments to learn more about thermal effects caused by virtual worlds and avatars.

Capturing and modeling these multiscale structures is challenging but essential for computer graphics, engineering, and materials science. We present a framework inspired by hypertexture methods, using implicit functions and adaptive sphere tracing to synthesize multiscale structures on the fly without precomputation. This framework models volumetric materials with particulate, fibrous, porous, and laminar structures, allowing control over size, shape, density, distribution, and orientation. We enhance structural diversity by superimposing implicit periodic functions while improving computational efficiency. The framework also supports spatially varying particulate media, particle agglomeration, and piling on convex and concave structures, such as rock formations (mesoscale), without explicit simulation. We show its potential in the appearance modeling of volumetric materials and explore how spatially varying properties influence perceived macroscale appearance. Our framework enables seamless multiscale modeling, reconstructing procedural volumetric materials from image and signed distance field (SDF) synthetic exemplars using first-order and gradient-free optimization.

As such, development of automated systems capable of detecting such events is of considerable importance in both academic and industrial contexts. In this work, we investigate the use of deep learning for detecting thermal runaway in the battery production line of VDL Nedcar, a Dutch automobile manufacturer. Specifically, we collect data from the production line to represent both baseline (non thermal runaway) and thermal runaway conditions. Thermal runaway was simulated through the use of external heat and smoke sources. The data consisted of both optical and thermal images which were then preprocessed and fused before serving as input to our models. In this regard, we evaluated three deep-learning models widely used in computer vision including shallow convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and vision transformers on two performance metrics. Furthermore, we evaluated these models using explainability methods to gain insight into their ability to capture the relevant feature information from their inputs. The obtained results indicate that the use of deep learning is a viable approach to thermal runaway detection in battery production lines.

Fouling, the gradual accumulation of solids on heat transfer surfaces, causes a time-varying decrease in the overall heat transfer coefficient (U(t)), significantly impacting the efficiency of heat transfer. Good estimation and modeling of fouling (the heat transfer coefficient) will lead to better fouling mitigation strategies. This study investigates the identifiability of the time-varying $U(t)$ in HEXs from closed-loop operational data, without external excitation of reference signals or knowledge of the controller parameters. We establish that while the complete system model cannot be identified under these given constraints, the time-varying heat transfer coefficient $U(t)$ remains identifiable. Further, we propose a neural network based architecture, called (Per-PINN), for estimation and modeling the heat transfer coefficient from the closed-loop system data. This Per-PINN model is shown to perform better than the existing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) based models for inverse parameter learning as it inherently fixes the underlying physical equations and learns only the time-varying parameter U(t).

A 100-meter-scale mission in a near-circular low Earth orbit has been identified as an ideal, cost-effective setting for demonstrating SILVIA, as this configuration maintains a good balance between small relative perturbations and low risk for collision. This mission will fill the current technology gap towards future missions, including gravitational wave observatories such as DECIGO (DECihertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory), designed to detect the primordial gravitational wave background, and high-contrast nulling infrared interferometers like LIFE (Large Interferometer for Exoplanets), designed for direct imaging of thermal emissions from nearby terrestrial planet candidates.

Traditional control methods rely on static heating curves that are based solely on outdoor temperature, neglecting system state measurements, such as indoor temperature, and free heat sources, such as solar gain. A more effective strategy is model predictive control (MPC), which optimizes heating control by incorporating system state predictions based on weather forecasts, among other factors. However, current industrial MPC solutions often employ simplified physics-inspired indoor temperature models, sacrificing accuracy for robustness and interpretability. To bridge this gap, we propose a partially stochastic deep learning (DL) architecture for building-specific indoor temperature modeling. Unlike most studies that evaluate model performance through simulations or limited test buildings, our experiments across a large dataset of 100 real-world buildings, covering various heating season conditions, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms a widely used industrial physics-based model in predictive accuracy. The proposed DL architecture shows significant potential to improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency in heating MPC solutions. Although its computational cost is higher than that of the reference model, we discuss why this trade-off is manageable, even in large-scale applications. Unlike deterministic black-box approaches, the partially stochastic DL model offers a critical advantage by enabling pre-assessment of model feasibility through predictive uncertainty quantification. This work advances heating MPC, particularly for buildings with comprehensive datasets on their thermal behavior under various weather conditions.

The design objectives for heat exchangers include maximizing the heat exchange rate while minimizing the pressure drop, requiring both a large interface area and a smooth internal structure. State-of-the-art designs, such as triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), have proven effective in optimizing heat exchange efficiency. However, TPMS designs are constrained by predefined mathematical equations, limiting their adaptability to freeform boundary shapes. Additionally, TPMS structures do not inherently control flow directions, which can lead to flow stagnation and undesirable pressure drops.
  This paper presents DualMS, a novel computational framework for optimizing dual-channel minimal surfaces specifically for heat exchanger designs in freeform shapes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to directly optimize minimal surfaces for two-fluid heat exchangers, rather than relying on TPMS. Our approach formulates the heat exchange maximization problem as a constrained connected maximum cut problem on a graph, with flow constraints guiding the optimization process. To address undesirable pressure drops, we model the minimal surface as a classification boundary separating the two fluids, incorporating an additional regularization term for area minimization. We employ a neural network that maps spatial points to binary flow types, enabling it to classify flow skeletons and automatically determine the surface boundary. DualMS demonstrates greater flexibility in surface topology compared to TPMS and achieves superior thermal performance, with lower pressure drops while maintaining a similar heat exchange rate under the same material cost.

It demonstrates scalability and practicality for large solar thermal plants, enhancing overall performance. The method was first validated through simulations on a realistic solar plant model, then adapted and successfully tested in a 50 MW solar trough plant, demonstrating its advantages.

This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that combines physics-based thermal modeling with data-driven techniques to identify and correct power losses accurately using only temperature measurements. Our approach leverages a cascaded architecture where a neural network learns to correct the outputs of a nominal power loss model by backpropagating through a reduced-order thermal model. We explore two neural architectures, a bootstrapped feedforward network, and a recurrent neural network, demonstrating that the bootstrapped feedforward approach achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications. Between the interconnection, we included normalization strategies and physics-guided training loss functions to preserve stability and ensure physical consistency. Experimental results show that our hybrid model reduces both temperature estimation errors (from 7.2+-6.8Â°C to 0.3+-0.3Â°C) and power loss prediction errors (from 5.4+-6.6W to 0.2+-0.3W) compared to traditional physics-based approaches, even in the presence of thermal model uncertainties. This methodology allows us to accurately estimate power losses without direct measurements, making it particularly helpful for real-time industrial applications where sensor placement is hindered by cost and physical limitations.

A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.

Volcanic Radiative Power (VPR), derived from thermal remote sensing data, serves as an essential indicator of volcanic activity. In this study, we employ Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks (BRNN) to predict future VPR values based on historical data from Fuego Volcano, comparing its performance against Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) models. The results indicate that BRNN outperforms SCG and LM, achieving the lowest mean squared error (1.77E+16) and the highest R-squared value (0.50), demonstrating its superior ability to capture VPR variability while minimizing overfitting. Despite these promising results, challenges remain in improving the model's predictive accuracy. Future research should focus on integrating additional geophysical parameters, such as seismic and gas emission data, to enhance forecasting precision. The findings highlight the potential of machine learning models, particularly BRNN, in advancing volcanic activity forecasting, contributing to more effective early warning systems for volcanic hazards.

Using Hamilton's variational principle, the system is modeled as a rotating slender Timoshenko beam under thermal and aerodynamic loads, described by a coupled system of 2*2 hyperbolic PIDEs, parabolic PDE, and ODEs, where the nonlocal terms exist in the hyperbolic PDE domain, and where the external disturbance (heat flux) flows into one boundary of the heat PDE. For the general form of such mixed systems, we present the state-feedback control design based on the PDE backstepping method, and then design an extended state observer for the unmeasurable distributed states and external disturbances using only available boundary measurements. In the resulting output-feedback closed-loop system, the state of the uncontrolled boundary, i.e., the furthest state from the control input, is proved to be exponentially convergent to zero, and all signals are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, if the external disturbance vanishes, the exponential stability of the overall system is obtained. The proposed control design is validated on an aero-engine flexible blade under extreme thermal and aerodynamic conditions.

The primary aging mechanism in discrete semiconductors and power modules is the bond wire lift-off, caused by crack growth due to thermal fatigue. The process is empirically characterized by exponential growth and an abrupt end of life, making long-term aging forecasts challenging. This research presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of different forecasting methods for MOSFET failure forecasting applications. Classical tracking, statistical forecasting and Neural Network (NN) based forecasting models are implemented along with novel Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs). A comprehensive comparison is performed assessing their MOSFET ageing forecasting ability for different forecasting horizons. For short-term predictions, all algorithms result in acceptable results, with the best results produced by classical NN forecasting models at the expense of higher computations. For long-term forecasting, only the TFT is able to produce valid outcomes owing to the ability to integrate covariates from the expected future conditions. Additionally, TFT attention points identify key ageing turning points, which indicate new failure modes or accelerated ageing phases.

The flow, considered for the study, is laminar and incompressible. The study employs an in-house Fortran-based solver to predict the thermal fields of Al$_2$O$_3$-water nanofluid flow through a two-dimensional rectangular channel, with the bottom wall subjected to a uniform heat flux. The performance of two models operating in one- and two-dimensional parametric spaces are investigated. Initially, a DMD with linear interpolation (DMD-LI) based solver is used for prediction of temperature of the nanofluid at any Re $>$ 100. The DMD-LI based model, predicts temperature fields with a maximum percentage difference of just 0.0273\%, in comparison with the CFD-based solver at Re =960, and $Îµ$ = 1.0\%. The corresponding difference in the average Nusselt numbers is only 0.39\%. Following that a DMD with bi-linear interpolation (DMD-BLI) based solver is used for prediction of temperature of the nanofluid at any Re $>$ 100 and $Îµ$ $>$ 0.5\%. The performance of two different ways of stacking the data are also examined. When compared to the CFD-based model, the DMD-BLI-based model predicts the temperature fields with a maximum percentage difference of 0.21 \%, at Re = 800 and $Îµ$ = 1.35\%. And the corresponding percentage difference in the average Nusselt number prediction is only 6.08\%. All the results are reported in detail.

The device integrates pneumatic and hydraulic actuation to simulate roughness, thermal, and softness cues on the proximal phalanx, enabling users to explore surroundings naturally with their fingertips. The rendering methodology dynamically modulates those cues based on the user's exploratory actions. We validated our approach by conducting a user study with fifteen participants, who matched six virtual textures generated by the ring to their real counterparts and rated their perceived sensations. Participants achieved up to ninety percent accuracy in texture matching. The adjective ratings confirmed that the ring delivers distinct, perceptually rich stimuli across all rendered sensations. These findings highlight the ring's potential for immersive XR applications, offering diverse tactile feedback without restricting physical interaction.

In this paper, a method based on arbitrary electric field direction modulation and isomerism electrodes is proposed to suppress or regulate it. With the aid of multi-physics Finite Element Method, Jones Matrix and the theory of photoelastic effect, it is found that metal or transparent isomerism electrodes can generate a special thermal stress distribution, which regulates the birefringence in the optical path and their induced measurement error. The experiment is conducted on a 10mm cubic bismuth germanite crystal, with cutting directions 110, -110 and 001. The experiment result shows that Cu isomerism electrodes with electric field angle of 59.9 degrees could generate 37% less birefringence error compared to parallel plate electrodes, in the temperature range from 25 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius. However, the Indium Tin Oxide electrodes with field angle of 29.6 degrees produces approximately 7 times error because of its bad ductility and thermal conduction. The proposed modeling and suppression method for birefringence is beneficial to design of high accuracy optical voltage sensor or electro-optical modulator.

Existing methods such as agent-based modeling (ABM) and empirical measurements fail to account for individual physiological variations and environmental perception mechanisms under thermal stress. This results in a lack of human-centred, heat-adaptive routing suggestions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Vision Language Model (VLM)-driven Persona-Perception-Planning-Memory (PPPM) framework that integrating street view imagery and urban network topology to simulate heat-adaptive pedestrian routing. Through structured prompt engineering on Gemini-2.0 model, eight distinct heat-sensitive personas were created to model mobility behaviors during heat exposure, with empirical validation through questionnaire survey. Results demonstrate that simulation outputs effectively capture inter-persona variations, achieving high significant congruence with observed route preferences and highlighting differences in the factors driving agents decisions. Our framework is highly cost-effective, with simulations costing 0.006USD and taking 47.81s per route. This Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) methodology advances urban climate adaptation research by enabling high-resolution simulation of thermal-responsive mobility patterns, providing actionable insights for climate-resilient urban planning.

It has been demonstrated in our previous work that SubChCFD is highly adaptable to HTGR fuel designs and performs exceptionally well in modelling steady-state processes. In this study, the approach is extended to simulate a Loss of Flow Accident (LOFA) transient, where coolant circulation is disrupted, causing the transition from forced convection to buoyancy-driven natural circulation within the reactor core. To enable SubChCFD to capture the complex physics involved, corrections were introduced to the empirical correlations to account for the effects of flow unsteadiness, property variation and buoyancy.
  A 1/12th sector of the reactor core, representing the smallest symmetric unit, was modelled using a coarse mesh of approximately 60 million cells. This mesh size is about 6% of that required for a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model, where mesh sizes can typically reach the order of 1 billion cells for such configurations. Simulation results show that SubChCFD effectively captures the thermal hydraulic behaviours of the reactor during a LOFA transient, producing predictions in good agreement with RANS simulations while significantly reducing computational cost.

An imbalance in charge levels affects the state of health of the battery, along with the concerns of thermal runaway and fire hazards. Traditional methods focus on safety assurance as a trade-off between safety and charging time. Others deal with battery-specific conditions to ensure safety, therefore losing on the generalization of the control strategies over various configurations of batteries. In this work, we propose a method to learn safe battery charging actions by using a safety-layer as an add-on over a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The safety layer perturbs the agent's action to prevent the battery from encountering unsafe or dangerous states. Further, our Deep RL framework focuses on learning a generalized policy that can be effectively employed with varying configurations of batteries. Our experimental results demonstrate that the safety-layer based action perturbation incurs fewer safety violations by avoiding unsafe states along with learning a robust policy for several battery configurations.

To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.

This paper proposes a novel multimodal depth estimation model, RTFusion, which enhances depth estimation accuracy and robustness by integrating the complementary strengths of RGB and THR data. The RGB modality provides rich texture and color information, while the THR modality captures thermal patterns, ensuring stability under adverse lighting conditions such as extreme illumination. The model incorporates a unique fusion mechanism, EGFusion, consisting of the Mutual Complementary Attention (MCA) module for cross-modal feature alignment and the Edge Saliency Enhancement Module (ESEM) to improve edge detail preservation. Comprehensive experiments on the MS2 and ViViD++ datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently produces high-quality depth maps across various challenging environments, including nighttime, rainy, and high-glare conditions. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method in applications requiring reliable depth estimation, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.

However, the widespread adoption of HBM presents significant thermal management challenges, particularly in multilayer through-silicon-via (TSV) stacked structures under varying thermal conditions, where accurate prediction of junction temperature and hotspot position is essential during the early design. This work develops a data-driven neural network model for the fast prediction of junction temperature and hotspot position in 3D HBM chiplets. The model, trained with a data set of $13,494$ different combinations of thermal condition parameters, sampled from a vast parameter space characterized by high-dimensional combination (up to $3^{27}$), can accurately and quickly infer the junction temperature and hotspot position for any thermal conditions in the parameter space. Moreover, it shows good generalizability for other thermal conditions not considered in the parameter space. The data set is constructed using accurate finite element solvers. This method not only minimizes the reliance on costly experimental tests and extensive computational resources for finite element analysis but also accelerates the design and optimization of complex HBM systems, making it a valuable tool for improving thermal management and performance in high-performance computing applications.

These materials were chosen for their low thermal expansion, ensuring geometric stability and rigidity necessary for accurate spatial measurements. The support system is scalable and adaptable for various applications and setups. The study further investigates the effects of camera placement and separation in near-parallel configurations on measurement accuracy and precision. Experimental results show a significant correlation between camera distance and measurement precision - closer camera setups yield higher precision. The optimized camera arrangement allowed the prototype to achieve accuracies of +/-0.74 mm along the camera's line of sight and +/-0.12 mm in orthogonal directions. The experiments show that the standard deviation of the noise on a single measurement plane orthogonal to the camera's line of sight vary between 0.02 and 0.07, indicating that the measurement noise is not constant for every point on that specific plane in the meanurement space. Details of the system's design and validation are provided to enhance reproducibility and encourage further development in areas like industrial automation and medical device tracking. By delivering a modular solution with validated accuracy, this work aims to promote innovation and practical application in precision tracking technology, facilitating broader adoption and iterative improvements. This approach enhances the accessibility and versatility of high-precision tracking technology, supporting future progress in the field.

Furthermore, we propose two sampling methods by integrating the infinite-dimensional LCHS with Gaussian quadrature schemes (Inf-LCHS-Gaussian) or Monte Carlo integration schemes (Inf-LCHS-MC). We demonstrate the applicability of the Inf-LCHS theorem to a wide range of non-Hermitian dynamics, including linear parabolic PDEs, queueing models (birth-or-death processes), SchrÃ¶dinger equations with complex potentials, Lindblad equations, and black hole thermal field equations. Our analysis provides insights into simulating general linear dynamics using a finite number of quantum dynamics and includes cost estimates for the corresponding quantum algorithms.

The main objective of the proposed virtual elements is to develop a stabilized virtual element problem that avoids higher-order derivative terms and bilinear forms involving velocity, pressure and temperature, thereby avoiding the coupling between virtual element pairs. Moreover, it also reduces the violation of divergence-free constraints and offers reasonable control over the gradient of temperature. We derive the stability of the continuous solution using the Banach fixed-point theorem under sufficiently small data. The stabilized coupled virtual element problem is formulated using the local projection-based stabilization methods. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the stabilized discrete solution using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and the contraction theorem under the assumption of sufficient small data by showing the well-posedness of the stabilized decoupled virtual element problems. Furthermore, we derive the error estimates with optimal convergence rates in the energy norms. We present several numerical examples to confirm the theoretical findings. Additionally, the numerical behavior of the proposed stabilized method is shown to be robust with respect to linear and non-linear thermal conductivity.

For commercial buildings with centralized systems, the efficiency of the chiller plant is vital, and model predictive control provides an effective strategy for optimizing operations through dynamic adjustments based on accurate load predictions. Artificial neural networks are effective for modelling nonlinear systems but are prone to overfitting due to their complexity. Effective feature engineering can mitigate this issue. While weather data are crucial for load prediction, they are often used as raw numerical inputs without advanced processing. Clustering features is a technique that can reduce model complexity and enhance prediction accuracy. Although previous studies have explored clustering algorithms for load prediction, none have applied them to multidimensional weather data, revealing a research gap. This study presents a cooling load prediction model that combines a neural network with Kalman filtering and K-means clustering. Applied to real world data from a commercial skyscraper in Singapore's central business district, the model achieved a 46.5% improvement in prediction accuracy. An optimal chiller sequencing strategy was also developed through genetic algorithm optimization of the predictive load, potentially saving 13.8% in energy. Finally, the study evaluated the integration of thermal energy storage into the chiller plant design, demonstrating potential reductions in capital and operational costs of 26% and 13%, respectively.

Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.

This study investigates the thermal performance of a 16-cell lithium-ion battery pack by optimizing cooling airflow configurations and integrating phase change materials (PCMs) for enhanced heat dissipation. Seven geometric configurations were evaluated under airflow speeds ranging from 0 to 15 m/s, reflecting the operational conditions of civilian drones. A comprehensive 3D simulation approach was used to analyze the effects of inlet and outlet configurations, airflow dynamics, and PCM phase transition behavior. Results indicate that the trapezoidal (wide-base) configuration, paired with a 5-inlet and 1-outlet setup, achieves the most balanced performance, effectively maintaining optimal operating temperatures across low and high-speed airflow conditions. PCM integration further stabilized thermal behavior, with phase change durations extending to 12.5 min under tested conditions. These findings highlight the importance of geometric optimization and material integration in advancing compact and reliable thermal management systems for energy-dense battery packs. This study provides a foundation for designing efficient cooling strategies tailored to lightweight applications such as drones and portable energy storage systems.

Fires can originate at any point within a structure, and simulating every potential fire scenario is both expensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) and an efficient machine learning framework for its identification. The MFSP is defined as the location at which a fire, if initiated, would cause the most severe detrimental impact on the building's stability, effectively representing the worst-case fire scenario. In our framework, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) serves as an efficient and differentiable agent for conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulators by predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift Ratio (MIDR) under fire, which then guides the training and evaluation of the MFSP predictor. Additionally, we enhance our framework with a novel edge update mechanism and a transfer learning-based training scheme. Evaluations on a large-scale simulation dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed framework in identifying the MFSP, offering a transformative tool for optimizing fire safety assessments in structural design. All developed datasets and codes are open-sourced online.

This paper introduces the levelised cost of demand response (LCODR) which is an analogous measure to the LCOS but crucially differs from it by considering consumer reward payments. Additionally, the value factor from cost estimations of variable renewable energy is adapted to account for the variable availability of DR. The LCODRs for four direct load control (DLC) schemes and twelve storage applications are estimated and contrasted against LCOS literature values for the most competitive storage technologies. The DLC schemes are vehicle-to-grid, smart charging, smart heat pumps, and heat pumps with thermal storage. The results show that only heat pumps with thermal storage consistently outcompete storage technologies with EV-based DR schemes being competitive for some applications. The results and the underlying methodology offer a tool for energy system stakeholders to assess the competitiveness of DR schemes even with limited user data.

Parametric solutions for such models are of great importance, enabling the optimization of production processes and considerable cost reductions. However, the complexity of the problem and diversity of spatio-temporal scales involved in the process pose significant challenges for traditional numerical methods. Surrogate models offer a powerful alternative by accelerating simulations and facilitating real-time monitoring and control. The present study presents an operator learning approach that relies on the deep operator network (DeepONet) and physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to predict the three-dimensional temperature distribution during melting and consolidation in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Parametric solutions for both single-track and multi-track scenarios with respect to tool path are obtained. To address the challenges in obtaining parametric solutions for multi-track scenarios using DeepONet architecture, a sequential PINN approach is proposed to efficiently manage the increased training complexity inherent in those scenarios. The accuracy and consistency of the model are verified against finite-difference computations. The developed surrogate allows us to efficiently analyze the effect of scanning paths and laser parameters on the thermal history.

Most of them are trained at low resolution but applied at fine resolution, and so they require a scale-invariance hypothesis that is not always adapted. Themain contribution of this work is the introduction of a Scale-Invariance-Free approach for training Neural Network (NN) models, and the implementation of two NN models, calledScale-Invariance-Free Convolutional Neural Network for Super-Resolution (SIF-CNN-SR) for the super-resolution of MODIS LST products. The Scale-Invariance-Free approach consists ontraining the models in order to provide LST maps at high spatial resolution that recover the initial LST when they are degraded at low resolution and that contain fine-scale texturesinformed by the high resolution NDVI. The second contribution of this work is the release of a test database with ASTER LST images concomitant with MODIS ones that can be usedfor evaluation of super-resolution algorithms. We compare the two proposed models, SIF-CNN-SR1 and SIF-CNN-SR2, with four state-of-the-art methods, Bicubic, DMS, ATPRK, Tsharp,and a CNN sharing the same architecture as SIF-CNN-SR but trained under the scale-invariance hypothesis. We show that SIF-CNN-SR1 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and the other two CNN models as evaluated with LPIPS and Fourier space metrics focusing on the analysis of textures. These results and the available ASTER-MODIS database for evaluation are promising for future studies on super-resolution of LST.

This design introduces three key modifications to enhance efficiency and compactness: a revised fuel salt composition, an alternative moderator material, and moderator pins surrounded by the molten salt fuel. Unlike traditional solid-fueled reactors that rely on excess positive reactivity at the beginning of life, the TAP concept employs a dynamic approach. The core's design, featuring a cylindrical geometry with square assemblies of moderator rods surrounded by flowing fuel salt, provides flexibility in adjusting the moderator-to-fuel ratio during operation - using movable moderator rods - further adding criticality control capability in addition to the control rods system. Shape optimization of the core can play a crucial role in enhancing performance and efficiency. By applying multiphysics continuous shape optimization techniques to key components, such as the unit cells of the TAP reactor or its moderator assemblies, we can fine-tune the reactor's geometry to achieve optimal performance in key physics like neutronics and thermal hydraulics. We explore this aspect using the optimization module in the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework which allows for multiphysics continuous shape optimization. The results reported here illustrate the benefits of applying continuous shape optimization in the design of nuclear reactor components and can help in extending the TAP reactor's performance.

ADPs capture atomic vibrations, reflecting thermal and structural properties, but traditional computation is often expensive. This paper introduces CartNet, a novel graph neural network (GNN) for efficiently predicting crystal properties by encoding atomic geometry into Cartesian coordinates alongside the crystal temperature. CartNet integrates a neighbour equalization technique to emphasize covalent and contact interactions, and a Cholesky-based head to ensure valid ADP predictions. We also propose a rotational SO(3) data augmentation strategy during training to handle unseen orientations. An ADP dataset with over 200,000 experimental crystal structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) was curated to validate the approach. CartNet significantly reduces computational costs and outperforms existing methods in ADP prediction by 10.87%, while delivering a 34.77% improvement over theoretical approaches. We further evaluated CartNet on other datasets covering formation energy, band gap, total energy, energy above the convex hull, bulk moduli, and shear moduli, achieving 7.71% better results on the Jarvis Dataset and 13.16% on the Materials Project Dataset. These gains establish CartNet as a state-of-the-art solution for diverse crystal property predictions. Project website and online demo: https://www.ee.ub.edu/cartnet

They are validated using ground experiments, but all aspects of the flight cannot be replicated on ground. This ground-to-flight mapping introduces uncertainties which need to be accounted for while designing any thermal protection system. Thus, precise computational models along with uncertainty quantification in the models are required to design the TPS. The focus of this study is to estimate the thermal material parameters of TPS based on the target reliability requirements using statistical methods. To perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) of a system, a simulated model of the system needs to be solved many times on statistical samples, increasing the computational time and cost of the overall process. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) model is used in the analysis instead of traditional physics based numerical solutions. The accuracy of PINN is comparable to that of the numerical solution. To find the parameter distribution, sampling of the parameter space is performed using Sequential Monte- Carlo (SMC) method. The sampling method is efficient as it generates samples based on the target distribution in parallel and it also generates diverse samples for proper UQ. Combining the use of both PINN predictive model and SMC sampling, the framework can approximate the parameter distributions that satisfy the TPS design reliability constraints. The framework achieved remarkable increases in the speed of performing the reliability analysis of the TPS. This reliability analysis can be used for design optimization of the TPS based on risk analysis along with other systems of the vehicle.

However, the presence of Î±_Ga2O3 and GaOOH layers around LM droplets impairs conductivity and performance. We tackle this issue by replacing the oxide layer with conductive silver (Ag) using an ultrasonic_assisted galvanic replacement reaction. The Ag_coated nanoparticles form aggregated, porous microparticles that are mixed with styrene_isoprene_styrene (SIS) polymers, resulting in a digitally printable composite with superior electrical conductivity and electromechanical properties compared to conventional fillers. Adding more LM enhances these properties further. The composite achieves EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) exceeding 75 dB in the X_band frequency range, even at 200 per cent strain, meeting stringent military and medical standards. It is applicable in wireless communications and Bluetooth signal blocking and as a thermal interface material (TIM). Additionally, we highlight its recyclability using a biodegradable solvent, underscoring its eco_friendly potential. This composite represents a significant advancement in stretchable electronics and EMI shielding, with implications for wearable and bioelectronic applications.

The proposed method features prosumers, multiple producers, and storage systems, which are essential components of 4th generation DHNs. These networks are characterized by their ability to optimize their operations, aiming to reduce supply temperatures, accommodate distributed heat sources, and leverage the flexibility provided by thermal inertia and storage, all crucial for achieving a fossil-fuel-free energy supply. Developing a smart energy management system to accomplish these goals requires detailed models of highly complex nonlinear systems and computational algorithms able to handle large-scale optimization problems. To address this, we introduce a graph-based optimization-oriented model that efficiently integrates distributed producers, prosumers, storage buffers, and bidirectional pipe flows, such that it can be implemented in a real-time MPC setting. Furthermore, we conduct several numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in closed-loop. Our findings demonstrate that the MPC methods achieved up to 9% cost improvement over traditional rule-based controllers while better maintaining system constraints.

This necessitates optimization approaches to support the identification of well performing designs while reducing the computational time of performance evaluation. In response, this paper proposes and evaluates a sequential approach for multi-objective design optimization of building geometry, fabric, HVAC system and controls for building performance. This approach involves sequential optimizations with optimal solutions from previous stages passed to the next. The performance of the sequential approach is benchmarked against a full factorial search, assessing its effectiveness in finding global optima, solution quality, reliability to scale and variations of problem formulations, and computational efficiency compared to the NSGA-II algorithm. 24 configurations of the sequential approach are tested on a multi-scale case study, simulating 874 to 4,147,200 design options for an office building, aiming to minimize energy demand while maintaining thermal comfort. A two-stage sequential process-(building geometry + fabric) and (HVAC system + controls) identified the same Pareto-optimal solutions as the full factorial search across all four scales and variations of problem formulations, demonstrating 100% effectiveness and reliability. This approach required 100,700 function evaluations, representing a 91.2% reduction in computational effort compared to the full factorial search. In contrast, NSGA-II achieved only 73.5% of the global optima with the same number of function evaluations. This research indicates that a sequential optimization approach is a highly efficient and robust alternative to the standard NSGA-II algorithm.

At their core, digital beamforming architectures provide key benefits such as faster beam search, interference nulling via zero-force beamforming, higher spectral capacity, and more increased flexibility. However, they generally tradeoff power consumption due to the large number of ADCs in such systems. This paper introduces an open-source MATLAB-based behavioral hardware model of a general digital beamforming system. More specifically, it models an end-to-end uplink between an arbitrary number of user elements (UEs) and an arbitrarily large base station (BS) with and without a strong interferer. This paper also presents and validates an equation-based model for the effects of interference on thermal and quantization noise. The behavioral model presented in this paper aims to deepen understanding of such digital beamforming systems to enable system designers to make optimizations. The results presented in this paper primarily center on implementations with low-resolution ADCs and, thus, focus on the effects of system parameters, including interferer strength, on quantization noise.

However, the scarcity of materials data with costly property labels in the vast chemical space presents a significant challenge for ML in efficiently predicting properties and uncovering structure-property relationships. Here, we propose a novel hierarchy-boosted funnel learning (HiBoFL) framework, which is successfully applied to identify semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($Îº_\mathrm{L}$). By training on only a few hundred materials targeted by unsupervised learning from a pool of hundreds of thousands, we achieve efficient and interpretable supervised predictions of ultralow $Îº_\mathrm{L}$, thereby circumventing large-scale brute-force \textit{ab initio} calculations without clear objectives. As a result, we provide a list of candidates with ultralow $Îº_\mathrm{L}$ for potential thermoelectric applications and discover a new factor that significantly influences structural anharmonicity. This HiBoFL framework offers a novel practical pathway for accelerating the discovery of functional materials.

However, existing methods often fail to effectively integrate temporal information and perform efficient cross-modal interactions, which constrain their adaptability to dynamic targets. In this paper, we propose BTMTrack, a novel framework for RGB-T tracking. The core of our approach lies in the dual-template backbone network and the Temporal-Modal Candidate Elimination (TMCE) strategy. The dual-template backbone effectively integrates temporal information, while the TMCE strategy focuses the model on target-relevant tokens by evaluating temporal and modal correlations, reducing computational overhead and avoiding irrelevant background noise. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Temporal Dual Template Bridging (TDTB) module, which facilitates precise cross-modal fusion through dynamically filtered tokens. This approach further strengthens the interaction between templates and the search region. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BTMTrack. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 72.3% precision rate on the LasHeR test set and competitive results on RGBT210 and RGBT234 datasets.

To accomplish this, it is necessary to address several critical challenges stemming from nonlinear battery characteristics, discrete switch states, dynamic system configurations, as well as the curse of dimensionality inherent in large-scale RBSs. Thus, we propose a unified modeling framework to accommodate various possible configurations of an RBS and even to cover different RBS designs and their hybrid combinations, enabling the problem formulation for the RBS optimal control and facilitating the RBS topology design.Further, to solve the formulated RBS optimal control problems, the search space is narrowed to encompass only the feasible solutions, thereby ensuring safe battery connections while substantially curtailing search efforts. These proposed techniques, focusing on unifying the system modeling and narrowing the search space, lay a solid foundation for effectively formulating and efficiently solving RBS optimal control problems. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed techniques are demonstrated by both simulation and experimental tests.

The simulation strongly depends on the thermophysical constants of the material, data of which is lacking for many elements. Effective values for the parameters may be determined with precision by means of an unambiguous reference provided by the melting point of the material, which is directly observed during the experiments. TLE may therefore be used to study the high temperature thermophysical and optical properties of the elements.

This paper proposes a novel technology, namely temperature-controlled smart charging, to coordinate the heating/charging power and reduce the total energy use of a solar-powered EV charging station. Instead of fixing the battery temperature setpoints, we analyze the thermal dynamics and inertia of EV batteries, and decide the optimal timing and proper amount of energy allocated for heating. In addition, a temperature-sensitive charging model is formulated with consideration of dynamic charging rates as well as battery health. We further tailor acceleration algorithms for large-scale EV charging, including the reduced-order dual decomposition and vehicle rescheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed temperature-controlled smart charging is superior in capturing the flexibility value of EV batteries and making full use of the rooftop solar energy. The proposed model typically achieves a 12.5--18.4% reduction in the charging cost and a 0.4--6.8% drop in the overhead energy use for heating.

Simultaneously, these systems become more susceptible to different aging mechanisms such as negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), and thermal cycling (TC), as well as the electromigration (EM) phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based task mapping method to improve the reliability of manycore systems considering the aforementioned aging mechanisms, which consists of three steps including bin packing, task-to-bin mapping, and task-to-core mapping. In the initial step, a density-based spatial application with noise (DBSCAN) clustering method is employed to compose some clusters (bins) based on the cores temperature. Then, the Q-learning algorithm is used for the two latter steps, to map the arrived task on a core such that the minimum thermal variation is occurred among all the bins. Compared to the state-of-the-art works, the proposed method is performed during runtime without requiring any parameter to be calculated offline. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated on 16, 32, and 64 cores systems using SPLASH2 and PARSEC benchmark suite applications. The results demonstrate up to 27% increase in the mean time to failure (MTTF) compared to the state-of-the-art task mapping techniques.

This paper presents a new nonlinear multilevel iterative method with two photon energy grids for solving the multigroup radiative transfer equation (RTE) coupled with the material energy balance equation (MEB). The multilevel system of equations of the method is formulated by means of a nonlinear projection approach. The RTE is projected over elements of phase space to derive the low-order equations of different types. The hierarchy of equations consists of (1) multigroup weighted flux equations which can be interpreted as the multigroup RTE averaged over subintervals of angular range and (2) the effective grey (one-group) equations which are spectrum averaged low-order quasidiffusion (aka variable Eddington factor) equations.

Although simple aiming strategies, such as directing all heliostats to the receivers equator, can maximize energy collection, they often result in uneven flux distributions that lead to hotspots, thermal stresses, and reduced receiver lifetimes. This paper presents a novel, data-driven approach that integrates constraint learning, neural network-based surrogates, and mathematical optimization to overcome these challenges. The methodology learns complex heliostat-to-receiver flux interactions from simulation data, constructing a surrogate model that is embedded into a tractable optimization framework. By maximizing a tailored quality score that balances energy collection and flux uniformity, the approach yields smoothly distributed flux profiles and mitigates excessive thermal peaks. An iterative refinement process, guided by the trust region and progressive data sampling, ensures the surrogate model improves the obtained solution by exploring new spaces during the iterations. Results from a real CSPT case study demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses conventional heuristic methods, offering flatter flux distributions and safer thermal conditions without a substantial loss in overall energy capture.

Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.

This study presents a novel unsupervised learning framework that identifies spatial subdomains with specific governing physics. It uses the partition of unity networks (POUs) to divide the space into subdomains, assigning unique nonlinear model parameters to each, which are integrated into the physics model. A vital feature of this method is a physics residual-based loss function that detects variations in physical properties without requiring labeled data. This approach enables the discovery of spatial decompositions and nonlinear parameters in partial differential equations (PDEs), optimizing the solution space by dividing it into subdomains and improving accuracy. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through applications in porous media thermal ablation and ice-sheet modeling, showcasing its potential for tackling real-world physics challenges.

Thermal inertial loads can be programmed to preferentially consume from renewable sources. The flexibility in power consumption of inertial loads therefore can be used to absorb the fluctuations in intermittently available renewable power sources, and promote reduction of fossil fuel based costly non-renewable generation. Under a model which promotes renewable consumption by penalizing the non-renewable, but does not account for variations in the end-user requirements, the optimal solution leads to all the users' temperatures behave in a lockstep fashion, that is the power is allocated in such a fashion that all the temperatures are brought to a common value and they are kept the same after that point, resulting in synchronization among all the loads. In the first part, we showed that under a model which additionally penalizes the comfort range violation, the optimal solution is in-fact of desynchronization nature, where the temperatures are intentionally kept apart to avoid power surges resulting from simultaneous comfort violation from many loads.

The integral representations follow from resolvent representations of physical fields involving these self-adjoint operators, such as the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and current density $\boldsymbol{J}$ associated with conductive media with local conductivity $\boldsymbolÏ$ and resistivity $\boldsymbolÏ$ matrices. In this article, we provide a discrete matrix analysis of this mathematical framework which parallels the continuum theory. We show that discretizations of the operators yield real-symmetric random matrices which are composed of projection matrices. We derive discrete resolvent representations for $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$ involving the matrices which lead to eigenvector expansions of $\boldsymbol{E}$ and $\boldsymbol{J}$. We derive discrete Stieltjes integral representations for the components of the effective conductivity and resistivity matrices, $\boldsymbolÏ^*$ and $\boldsymbolÏ^*$, involving spectral measures for the real-symmetric random matrices, which are given explicitly in terms of their real eigenvalues and orthonormal eigenvectors. We provide a projection method that uses properties of the projection matrices to show that the spectral measure can be computed by much smaller matrices, which leads to a more efficient and stable numerical algorithm for the computation of bulk transport coefficients and physical fields. We demonstrate this algorithm by numerically computing the spectral measure and current density for model 2D and 3D isotropic polycrystalline media with checkerboard microgeometry.

Traditional on-road autonomous methods struggle with dynamic terrains, leading to poor vehicle control in off-road conditions. Recent deep-learning models have used perception sensors along with kinesthetic feedback for navigation on such terrains. However, this approach has out-of-domain uncertainty. Factors like change in time of day and weather impacts the performance of the model. We propose a multi modal fusion network "IRisPath" capable of using Thermal and RGB images to provide robustness against dynamic weather and light conditions. To aid further works in this domain, we also open-source a day-night dataset with Thermal and RGB images along with pseudo-labels for traversability. In order to co-register for fusion model we also develop a novel method for targetless extrinsic calibration of Thermal, LiDAR and RGB cameras with translation accuracy of +/-1.7cm and rotation accuracy of +/-0.827degrees.

Temperature monitoring becomes particularly vital in settings characterized by close human proximity, often referred to as dense settings. However, existing research on non-invasive temperature estimation using thermal cameras has predominantly focused on sparse settings. Unfortunately, the risk of disease transmission is significantly higher in dense settings like movie theaters or classrooms. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop robust temperature estimation methods tailored explicitly for dense settings.
  Our study proposes a non-invasive temperature estimation system that combines a thermal camera with an edge device. Our system employs YOLO models for face detection and utilizes a regression framework for temperature estimation. We evaluated the system on a diverse dataset collected in dense and sparse settings. Our proposed face detection model achieves an impressive mAP score of over 84 in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Furthermore, the regression framework demonstrates remarkable performance with a mean square error of 0.18$^{\circ}$C and an impressive $R^2$ score of 0.96. Our experiments' results highlight the developed system's effectiveness, positioning it as a promising solution for continuous temperature monitoring in real-world applications. With this paper, we release our dataset and programming code publicly.

Automated detection of soiled floor in barns can contribute to improved management processes but also the derived information can be used to model emission dynamics. Previous research approaches to determine the puddle area require manual detection of the puddle in the barn. While humans can detect animal excretions on thermal images of a livestock barn, automated approaches using thresholds fail due to other objects of the same temperature, such as the animals themselves. In addition, various parameters such as the type of housing, animal species, age, sex, weather and unknown factors can influence the type and shape of excretions. Due to this heterogeneity, a method for automated detection of excretions must therefore be not only be accurate but also robust to varying conditions. These requirements can be met by using contemporary deep learning models from the field of artificial intelligence. This work is the first to investigate the suitability of different deep learning models for the detection of excretions in pigsties, thereby comparing established convolutional architectures with recent transformer-based approaches. The detection models Faster R-CNN, YOLOv8, DETR and DAB-DETR are compared and statistically assessed on two created training datasets representing two pig houses. We apply a method derived from nested cross-validation and report on the results in terms of eight common detection metrics. Our work demonstrates that all investigated deep learning models are generally suitable for reliably detecting excretions with an average precision of over 90%. The models also show robustness on out of distribution data that possesses differences from the conditions in the training data, however, with expected slight decreases in the overall detection performance.

However, the limited data available about precise values of these properties have been a barrier, leading to predictive models with limited precision or the ability to generalize. This is particularly true of lattice thermal conductivity (LTC): existing datasets of precise (ab initio, DFT-based) computed values are limited to a few dozen materials with little variability. Based on such datasets, we study the impact of transfer learning on both the precision and generalizability of a deep learning model (ParAIsite). We start from an existing model (MEGNet~\cite{Chen2019}) and show that improvements are obtained by fine-tuning a pre-trained version on different tasks. Interestingly, we also show that a much greater improvement is obtained when first fine-tuning it on a large datasets of low-quality approximations of LTC (based on the AGL model) and then applying a second phase of fine-tuning with our high-quality, smaller-scale datasets. The promising results obtained pave the way not only towards a greater ability to explore large databases in search of low thermal conductivity materials but also to methods enabling increasingly precise predictions in areas where quality data are rare.

Dynamic modelling and simulation is a key enabling factor in this field, as controlling such plants is a difficult task for which there is no previous experience and very short design times are expected. The steady-state initialization of those dynamic models is an essential step in the design process, but is unfortunately a difficult task which involves the numerical solution of large systems of nonlinear equations with iterative Newton methods, which is often prone to numerical failures.
  In this work, several strategies and methodologies are discussed to successfully achieve steady-state initialization of first-principles equation-based, object-oriented models of advanced thermal power generation systems. These are presented in the context of the Modelica modelling language, but could be applied to other equation-based, object-oriented modelling and simulation environments.

Although deep learning models have demonstrated considerable promise toward reliably detecting PI, the existing work fails to evaluate the performance on darker skin tones and varying data collection protocols. In this paper, we introduce a new thermal and optical imaging dataset of 35 participants focused on darker skin tones where temperature differences are induced through cooling and cupping protocols. We vary the image collection process to include different cameras, lighting, patient pose, and camera distance. We compare the performance of a small convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on either the thermal or the optical images on all skin tones. Our preliminary results suggest that thermography-based CNN is robust to data collection protocols for all skin tones.

The APGNN adaptively balances data-driven and physics-informed predictions, enhancing model accuracy and robustness across different environments. Our approach is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with comparisons to conventional data-driven models such as ResNet. For the synthetic data, 2D domains were generated using three distinct governing equations: the diffusion equation, the advection-diffusion equation, and the Poisson equation. Non-linear transformations were applied to these domains to emulate complex physical processes in image form.
  In real-world experiments, the APGNN consistently demonstrated superior performance in the diverse thermal image dataset. On the cucumber dataset, characterized by low material diversity and controlled conditions, APGNN and PGNN showed similar performance, both outperforming the data-driven ResNet. However, in the more complex thermal dataset, particularly for outdoor materials with higher environmental variability, APGNN outperformed both PGNN and ResNet by dynamically adjusting its reliance on physics-based versus data-driven insights. This adaptability allowed APGNN to maintain robust performance across structured, low-variability settings and more heterogeneous scenarios. These findings underscore the potential of adaptive physics-guided learning to integrate physical constraints effectively, even in challenging real-world contexts with diverse environmental conditions.

Temperature significantly influences the performance and safety of batteries. Battery thermal management systems can effectively control the temperature of batteries; therefore, the performance and safety can be ensured. However, the development process of battery thermal management systems is time-consuming and costly due to the extensive training dataset needed by data-driven models requiring enormous computational costs for finite element analysis. Therefore, a new approach to constructing surrogate models is needed in the era of AI. Physics-informed machine learning enforces the physical laws in surrogate models, making it the perfect candidate for estimating battery pack temperature distribution. In this study, we first developed a 21700 battery pack indirect liquid cooling system with cold plates on the top and bottom with thermal paste surrounding the battery cells. Then, the simplified finite element model was built based on experiment results. Due to the high coolant flow rate, the cold plates can be considered as constant temperature boundaries, while battery cells are the heat sources. The physics-informed convolutional neural network served as a surrogate model to estimate the temperature distribution of the battery pack. The loss function was constructed considering the heat conduction equation based on the finite difference method.

Existing thermal comfort models usually overlook temporal dynamics alongside spatial dependencies. We address this problem by introducing a spatio-temporal jump model that clusters data with persistence across both spatial and temporal dimensions. This framework enhances interpretability, minimizes abrupt state changes, and easily handles missing data. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering the true underlying partition. When applied to hourly environmental data gathered from a set of weather stations located across the city of Singapore, our proposal identifies meaningful thermal comfort regimes, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic urban settings and suitability for real-world monitoring. The comparison of these regimes with feedback on thermal preference indicates the potential of an unsupervised approach to avoid extensive surveys.

In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs between model accuracy and computational efficiency in PTES systems. We evaluate a range of PTES models, from physically detailed to simplified variants, focusing on their non-linear charging and discharging capabilities. Our results show that while detailed models provide the most accurate representation of PTES operation by considering mass flow rate ($\dot{m}$) and state of charge (SoC) dependencies, they come at the cost of increased computational complexity. In contrast, simplified models tend to produce overly optimistic predictions by disregarding capability constraints. Other approximated model variants offer a practical compromise, balancing computational efficiency with acceptable accuracy. In particular, models that disregard $\dot{m}$-dependency and approximate nonlinear SoC-dependency with a piecewise linear function achieve similar accuracy to more detailed models but with significantly faster computation times. Our findings offer guidance to modelers in selecting the appropriate PTES representation for their investment models.

Footbaths, a simple yet highly effective therapeutic practice, have been used for centuries across various cultures to promote relaxation and overall well-being. This study presents a novel approach to simulating the experience of a public footbath through the use of tactile and thermal stimulation of airflow to the calf and those on the foot soles. Our system aims to offer a realistic and immersive virtual footbath experience without the need for actual water, by controlling the temperature and airflow to mimic the sensation of soaking feet in water or a water wave. Without using actual water, our system can be more compact, highly responsive, and more reproducible. The layer of airflow is made as thin as possible by adjusting air outlet, and the Coanda effect is also considered to generate a water surface more realistic. The system can provide a multi-sensory experience, including visual and audio feedback of water flow, enhancing the relaxation and therapeutic benefits of a footbath.

A newly developed quantum Gibbs sampling algorithm by Chen, Kastoryano, and GilyÃ©n provides an efficient simulation of the detailed-balanced dissipative dynamics of non-commutative quantum systems. The running time of this algorithm depends on the mixing time of the corresponding quantum Markov chain, which has not been rigorously bounded except in the high-temperature regime. In this work, we establish a polylog(n) upper bound on its mixing time for various families of random n by n sparse Hamiltonians at any constant temperature. We further analyze how the choice of the jump operators for the algorithm and the spectral properties of these sparse Hamiltonians influence the mixing time. Our result places this method for Gibbs sampling on par with other efficient algorithms for preparing low-energy states of quantumly easy Hamiltonians.

However, climate change, among other problems, makes these objectives difficult to achieve. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon that occurs in cities, increasing their thermal stress, is one of the stumbling blocks to achieve a more sustainable city. The ability to estimate temperatures with a high degree of accuracy allows for the identification of the highest priority areas in cities where urban improvements need to be made to reduce thermal discomfort. In this work we explore the usefulness of image-to-image deep neural networks (DNNs) for correlating spatial and meteorological variables of a urban area with street-level air temperature. The air temperature at street-level is estimated both spatially and temporally for a specific use case, and compared with existing, well-established numerical models. Based on the obtained results, deep neural networks are confirmed to be faster and less computationally expensive alternative for ground-level air temperature compared to numerical models.

The proposed method computes design sensitivities based on the adjoint variable method, and the adjoint equation is solved in the same manner as LKS; thus, we refer to it as the Adjoint Lattice Kinetic Scheme (ALKS). A key contribution of this method is the proposed approximate treatment of boundary conditions for the adjoint equation, which is challenging to apply directly due to the characteristics of LKS boundary conditions. We demonstrate numerical examples for steady and unsteady problems involving non-thermal and thermal fluids, and the results are physically meaningful and consistent with previous research, exhibiting similar trends in parameter dependencies, such as the Reynolds number. Furthermore, the proposed method reduces memory usage by up to 75% compared to the conventional LBM in an unsteady thermal fluid problem.

The rate of convergence in probability is almost 1/2 for a multiplicative noise; this relies on moment estimates in various norms for the processes and the scheme.
  In case of an additive noise, due to the coupling of the equations, provided that the difference on temperature between the top and bottom parts of the torus is not too big compared to the viscosity and thermal diffusivity, a strong polynomial rate of convergence (almost 1/2) is proven in $(L^2(D))^2$ for the velocity and in $L^2(D)$ for the temperature.
  It depends on exponential moments of the scheme; due to linear terms involving the other quantity in both evolution equations, the proof has to be done simultaneaously for both the velocity and the temperature. These rates in both cases are similar to that obtained for the Navier-Stokes equation.

Over the past decade, significant progress has also been made on their rigorous convergence analysis.
  Heisenberg antiferromagnets (AFM) with bipartite interaction graphs are a popular target of computational QMC studies due to their physical importance, but despite the apparent empirical efficiency of these simulations it remains an open question whether efficient classical approximation of the ground energy is possible in general. In this work we introduce a ground state variant of the stochastic series expansion QMC method, and for the special class of AFM on interaction graphs with an $O(1)$-bipartite component (star-like), we prove rapid mixing of the associated QMC Markov chain (polynomial time in the number of qubits) by using Jerrum and Sinclair's method of canonical paths. This is the first Markov chain analysis of a practical class of QMC algorithms with the loop representation of Heisenberg models.
  Our findings contribute to the broader effort to resolve the computational complexity of Heisenberg AFM on general bipartite interaction graphs.

We significantly reduce the computational cost associated with forward PDE evaluations by employing automatic differentiation, enabling a more efficient and scalable reconstruction process. This allows the inverse problem to be solved with fewer sensors and observations. Specifically, we demonstrate the successful reconstruction of thermal conductivity on the 1D circle and 2D torus, using one and four moving sensors, respectively, with their positions recorded over time. Our method incorporates sampling algorithms to compute confidence intervals for the reconstructed conductivity, improving robustness against measurement noise. Extensive numerical simulations of heat dynamics validate the efficacy of our approach, confirming both the accuracy and stability of the reconstructed thermal conductivity. Additionally, the method is thoroughly tested using large datasets from machine learning, allowing us to evaluate its performance across various scenarios and ensure its reliability. This approach provides a cost-effective and flexible solution for conductivity reconstruction from sparse measurements, making it a robust tool for solving inverse problems in complex domains.

As two types of the most common and intuitive thermal adaptive behaviors, precise recognition of dressing and undressing can effectively support thermal comfort prediction. However, traditional activity recognition suffers from shortcomings in privacy, cost, and performance. To address the above issues, this study proposes a cross-domain transfer learning method for human dressing and undressing adaptive behavior recognition with WiFi. First, we determine the activity interval by calculating the sliding variance for denoised WiFi signals. Subsequently, short-time Fourier transform and discrete wavelet transform are performed to extract action information on the basis of time-frequency analysis. Ultimately, an efficient 1D CNN pre-trained model is integrated with the SVM algorithm as a hybrid model to enhance the identification robustness in new scenarios. Experiment results show that the hybrid model based on transfer learning provides a more accurate prediction for the adaptative behavior of target subjects, achieving 96.9% and 94.9% accuracy in two cases, respectively.

The elimination of fossil fuel fired systems, and their replacement with intermittent renewable sources and other electric equipment will require better load management techniques to ensure a reliable grid. One strategy for maintaining electric grid reliability utilizes peak shaving. Buildings, accounting for 40% of energy use in the United States, can account for an even higher percentage of energy during peak periods driven by high air conditioning loads during the summer, especially in hotter climes such as Austin, Texas. Many previous studies have modeled the effectiveness of building HVAC demand response methods such as temperature setpoint manipulation, pre-cooling, ventilation scheduling, and thermal energy storage. Thermal storage systems, due to their larger energy capacities, have been shown to be most promising for peak shaving. However, there is a lack of work integrating chilled water energy storage models with validated microgrid-district energy system models to fully capture the dynamics of the proposed strategies. Previously, a validated system model for power generation and heating was developed for the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). A new validated model integrates the 65 MW combined heat and power plant (CHP), with the campus' 45,000 ton district cooling system, as well as two chilled water storage tanks. While the existing campus system currently utilizes an operator driven peak shaving strategy utilizing thermal storage, optimization results show that there is room for further improvement and energy savings. The presented results quantify the peak shaving in MW and provide a foundation for further analysis.

In response to these limitations, we have developed a real-time pore detection method using thermal sensor data, offering a more efficient, cost-effective alternative for quality control during the LPBF process. Our method, validated against CT-scanned pore counts, provides a high degree of accuracy, achieving an R^2 value of 0.94 between the across eight sample prints. This approach also effectively tracks pore formation trends as the layer-wise printing pattern changes, providing timely insights into product quality, which may serve as important datapoints for real-time adaptive parameters optimization in the future.

Of the various thermal comfort indicators, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) is very challenging to measure. Most common measurement methodologies are time-consuming and not user-friendly. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel MRT measurement framework that uses visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and semantic segmentation techniques. The proposed approach follows the rule of thumb of the traditional MRT calculation method using surface temperature and view factors. However, it employs visual SLAM and creates a 3D thermal point cloud with enriched surface temperature information. The framework then implements Grounded SAM, a new object detection and segmentation tool to extract features with distinct temperature profiles on building surfaces. The detailed segmentation of thermal features not only reduces potential errors in the calculation of the MRT but also provides an efficient reconstruction of the spatial MRT distribution in the indoor environment. We also validate the calculation results with the reference measurement methodology. This data-driven framework offers faster and more efficient MRT measurements and spatial mapping than conventional methods. It can enable the direct engagement of researchers and practitioners in MRT measurements and contribute to research on thermal comfort and radiant cooling and heating systems.

In contrast, there have been only a few attempts to apply Transformers in engineering physics. Aiming to offer an easy entry point to physics-centric Transformers, we introduce a physics-informed Transformer model for solving the heat conduction problem in a 2D plate with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The model is implemented in the machine learning framework MLX and leverages the unified memory of Apple M-series processors. The use of MLX means that the models can be trained and perform predictions efficiently on personal machines with only modest memory requirements. To train, validate and test the Transformer model we solve the 2D heat conduction problem using central finite differences. Each finite difference solution in these sets is initialized with four random Dirichlet boundary conditions, a uniform but random internal temperature distribution and a randomly selected thermal diffusivity. Validation is performed in-line during training to monitor against over-fitting. The excellent performance of the trained model is demonstrated by predicting the evolution of the temperature field to steady state for the unseen test set of conditions.

Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together.  In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.

Emotional states play a vital role in shaping behaviors, decisions, and social interactions. However, emotional expressions can be influenced by contextual factors, leading to misinterpretations if context is not considered. Multimodal fusion, combining modalities like facial expressions, speech, and physiological signals, has shown promise in improving affect recognition. This paper proposes a transformer-based multimodal fusion approach that leverages facial thermal data, facial action units, and textual context information for context-aware emotion recognition. We explore modality-specific encoders to learn tailored representations, which are then fused using additive fusion and processed by a shared transformer encoder to capture temporal dependencies and interactions. The proposed method is evaluated on a dataset collected from participants engaged in a tangible tabletop Pacman game designed to induce various affective states.

Specifically, this approach simultaneously optimized Indoor Overheating Hours (IOH) and Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) metrics through an Overall Desirability (D). The lack of significant association between IOH and other annual daylight metrics enabled a focused optimization of IOH and UDI. Each response required only 138 simulation runs (~30 hours for 276 runs) to determine the optimal values for passive strategies: window-to-wall ratio (WWR) and roof overhang depth across four orientations, totalling eight factors. First, initial screening based on $2_V^{8-2}$ fractional factorial design, identified four key factors using stepwise and Lasso regression, narrowed down to three: roof overhang depth on the south and west, WWR on the west, and WWR on the south. Then, RSM optimization yielded an optimal solution (roof overhang: 3.78 meters, west WWR: 3.76%, south WWR: 29.3%) with a D of 0.625 (IOH: 8.33%, UDI: 79.67%). Finally, robustness analysis with 1,000 bootstrap replications provided 95% confidence intervals for the optimal values. This study optimally balances thermal comfort and daylight with few experiments using a computationally-efficient multi-objective approach.

Multiple approaches have been introduced to achieve such goals, typically obtrusive and non-obtrusive. Amongst the obtrusive approaches are the wearable devices, and among the non-obtrusive approaches are the movement detection systems, including motion sensors and thermal sensor arrays (TSAs). TSA systems are advantageous when preserving a person's privacy and picking his precise spatial location. In this study, human daily living activities were monitored day and night, constructing the corresponding activity time series and spatial probability distribution and employing a TSA system. The monitored activities are classified into two categories: sleeping and daily activity. Results showed the possibility of distinguishing between classes regardless of day and night. The obtained sleep activity duration was compared with previous research using the same raw data. Results showed that the duration of sleep activity, on average, was 9 hours/day, and daily life activity was 7 hours/day. The person's spatial probability distribution was determined using the bivariate distribution for the monitored location. In conclusion, the results showed that sleeping activity was dominant. Our study showed that TSAs were the optimum choice when monitoring human activity. Our proposed approach tackled limitations encountered by previous human activity monitoring systems, such as preserving human privacy while knowing his precise spatial location.

They provide pivotal flexibilities to counter uncertainties from renewables, preferably by participating in electricity markets. Unlike thermal generators, however, the dominant type of cost for batteries is opportunity cost, which is more vague and challenging to represent through bids in stipulated formats. This article shows the opposite yet surprising results: The demand-supply function of an ideal battery, considering its opportunity cost, is a staircase function with no more than five segments, which is a perfect match with existing rules in many real electricity markets. The demand-supply function shifts horizontally with price forecasts and vertically with the initial SOC. These results can be generalized to imperfect batteries and numerous battery-like resources, including battery clusters, air-conditioners, and electric vehicle charging stations, although the number of segments may vary. These results pave the way for batteries to participate in electricity markets.

Buildings and structures are neither inherently susceptible to fire nor completely fire-resistant; their vulnerability largely depends on the specific causes of the fire, which can stem from natural events or human-induced hazards. High temperatures in structures can lead to severe health risks for those directly affected, discomfort due to smoke, and compromised safety if the structure fails to meet safety standards. Elevated temperatures can also cause significant structural damage, becoming the primary cause of casualties, economic losses, and material damage. This study aims to investigate the thermal and structural behavior of concrete beams when exposed to extreme fire conditions. It examines the effects of different temperatures on plain and reinforced concrete (PCC and RCC, respectively) using finite element method (FEM) simulations. Additionally, the study explores the performance of various concrete grades under severe conditions. The analysis reveals that higher-grade concrete exhibits greater displacement, crack width, stress, and strain but has lower thermal conductivity compared to lower-grade concrete. These elevated temperatures can induce severe stresses in the concrete, leading to expansion, spalling, and the potential failure of the structure. Reinforced concrete, on the other hand, shows lower stress concentrations and minimal strain up to 250Â°C. These findings contribute to the existing knowledge and support the development of improved fire safety regulations and performance-based design methodologies.

The autoregressive sequence is by definition one-dimensional (1D), which is natural for language tasks and hence an important component of modern architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. However, when language models are used to predict outputs on physical systems that are not intrinsically 1D, the question arises of which choice of autoregressive sequence -- if any -- is optimal. In this paper, we study the reconstruction of critical correlations in the two-dimensional (2D) Ising model, using RNNs and transformers trained on binary spin data obtained near the thermal phase transition. We compare the training performance for a number of different 1D autoregressive sequences imposed on finite-size 2D lattices. We find that paths with long 1D segments are more efficient at training the autoregressive models compared to space-filling curves that better preserve the 2D locality. Our results illustrate the potential importance in choosing the optimal autoregressive sequence ordering when training modern language models for tasks in physics.

However, ensuring the accuracy of quantized models typically involves calibration using training data, which may be inaccessible due to privacy concerns. In such cases, zero-shot quantization, a technique that relies on pretrained models and statistical information without the need for specific training data, becomes valuable. Exploring zero-shot quantization in the infrared domain is important due to the prevalence of infrared imaging in sensitive fields like medical and security applications. In this work, we demonstrate how to apply zero-shot quantization to an object detection model retrained with thermal imagery. We use batch normalization statistics of the model to distill data for calibration. RGB image-trained models and thermal image-trained models are compared in the context of zero-shot quantization. Our investigation focuses on the contributions of mean and standard deviation statistics to zero-shot quantization performance. Additionally, we compare zero-shot quantization with post-training quantization on a thermal dataset. We demonstrated that zero-shot quantization successfully generates data that represents the training dataset for the quantization of object detection models. Our results indicate that our zero-shot quantization framework is effective in the absence of training data and is well-suited for the infrared domain.

The binocular stereo imaging technique has been widely used to measure waves. However, the optical properties of indoor water surfaces, including transparency, specular reflection, and texture absence, pose challenges for image processing and stereo reconstruction. This study proposed a novel technique that combined thermal stereography and deep learning to achieve fully noncontact wave measurements. The optical imaging properties of water in the long-wave infrared spectrum were found to be suitable for stereo matching, effectively avoiding the issues in the visible-light spectrum. After capturing wave images using thermal stereo cameras, a reconstruction strategy involving deep learning techniques was proposed to improve stereo matching performance. A generative approach was employed to synthesize a dataset with ground-truth disparity from unannotated infrared images. This dataset was then fed to a pretrained stereo neural network for fine-tuning to achieve domain adaptation. Wave flume experiments were conducted to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed technique. The final reconstruction results indicated great agreement and high accuracy with a mean bias of less than 2.1% compared with the measurements obtained using wave probes, suggesting that the novel technique effectively measures the spatiotemporal distribution of wave surface in hydrodynamic experiments.

Unlike additive noise, which typically arises from thermal processes or external factors, multiplicative noise is inherent to the system, originating from the fluctuation in diffuse reflections. These fluctuations result in multiple copies of the same signal with varying magnitudes being combined. Consequently, despeckling, or removing multiplicative noise, necessitates different techniques compared to those used for additive noise removal.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach using Stochastic Differential Equations based diffusion models to address multiplicative noise. We demonstrate that multiplicative noise can be effectively modeled as a Geometric Brownian Motion process in the logarithmic domain. Utilizing the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive the corresponding reverse process for image denoising. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on two different datasets, comparing our approach to both classical signal processing techniques and contemporary CNN-based noise removal models. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on perception-based metrics such as FID and LPIPS, while maintaining competitive performance on traditional metrics like PSNR and SSIM.

However, tracking methods trained on RGB datasets suffer a significant drop-off in TIR data due to the domain shift issue. To this end, in this work, we propose a Progressive Domain Adaptation framework for TIR Tracking (PDAT), which transfers useful knowledge learned from RGB tracking to TIR tracking. The framework makes full use of large-scale labeled RGB datasets without requiring time-consuming and labor-intensive labeling of large-scale TIR data. Specifically, we first propose an adversarial-based global domain adaptation module to reduce domain gap on the feature level coarsely. Second, we design a clustering-based subdomain adaptation method to further align the feature distributions of the RGB and TIR datasets finely. These two domain adaptation modules gradually eliminate the discrepancy between the two domains, and thus learn domain-invariant fine-grained features through progressive training. Additionally, we collect a largescale TIR dataset with over 1.48 million unlabeled TIR images for training the proposed domain adaptation framework. Experimental results on five TIR tracking benchmarks show that the proposed method gains a nearly 6% success rate, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Computational homogenization is useful for predicting macroscopic properties from the microscopic material constitution. It involves defining a representative volume element (RVE), solving governing equations, and evaluating its properties such as conductivity and elasticity. Despite its effectiveness, the approach can be computationally expensive. This study proposes a tensor-train (TT)-based asymptotic homogenization method to address these challenges. By deriving boundary value problems at the microscale and expressing them in the TT format, the proposed method estimates material properties efficiently. We demonstrate its validity and effectiveness through numerical experiments applying the proposed method for homogenization of thermal conductivity and elasticity in two- and three-dimensional materials, offering a promising solution for handling the multiscale nature of heterogeneous systems.

Since these snapshots are determined by a sufficiently detailed discretization, the offline phase is often computationally extremely costly. We suggest to replace the serial determination of one snapshot after the other by a parallel approach. In order to do so, we introduce a batch size $b$ and add $b$ snapshots to the current basis in every greedy iteration. These snapshots are computed in parallel. We prove convergence rates for this new batch greedy algorithm and compare them to those of the classical (weak) greedy algorithm in the Hilbert and Banach space case. Then, we present numerical results where we apply a (parallel) implementation of the proposed algorithm to the linear elliptic thermal block problem. We analyze the convergence rate as well as the offline and online wall-clock times for different batch sizes. We show that the proposed variant can significantly speed-up the offline phase while the size of the reduced problem is only moderately increased. The benefit of the parallel batch greedy increases for more complicated problems.

The current work describes the employment of an integrated experimental-numerical approach to assess the microstructure evolution of dislocation loops and voids in tungsten proposed for fusion application. Cluster dynamics (CD) model is implemented and simulations are performed on the irradiated tungsten Disk shape Compact Tension (DCT) specimen used in the experimental test. TEM characterisation is performed on the DCT specimen irradiated at 400 Â°C and 600 Â°C with around 1 dpa, respectively. The dpa rate and cascade overlap rate from the experiments and SPECTRA-PKA code, respectively, are implemented in the CD model. Based on the comparison between experimental and computational results, the dose and temperature dependence of irradiation-induced defects (dislocation loops, voids, c15 clusters) are clearly observed. Trap mediated diffusion is studied and the impact of cascades with the pre-existing defects is analysed through full cascade overlap mode and the consequent influence on the defect concentration is evaluated. The exchange of self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) and the change in the size of loops through reaction between <111> and <100> loops are studied in detail by means of the transfer rate of the SIAs.

Detection on infrared images is shown to outperform that on visible images, but the infrared correction pipeline is crucial since the models cannot extract information from raw infrared images. Two thermal correction pipelines are studied, the shutter and the shutterless pipes. Experiments show that some correction algorithms like spatial denoising are detrimental to performance even if they increase visual quality for a human observer. Other algorithms like destriping and, to a lesser extent, temporal denoising, increase computational time, but have some role to play in increasing detection accuracy. As it stands, the optimal trade-off for speed and accuracy is simply to use the shutterless pipe with a tonemapping algorithm only, for autonomous driving applications within varied environments.

This work aims to enhance temporal resolution in dynamic MR temperature map reconstruction using an improved deep learning method. The training-optimized methods and five classical neural networks were applied on the 2-fold and 4-fold under-sampling k-space data to reconstruct the temperature maps. The enhanced training modules included offline/online data augmentations, knowledge distillation, and the amplitude-phase decoupling loss function. The heating experiments were performed by a FUS transducer on phantom and ex vivo tissues, respectively. These data were manually under-sampled to imitate acceleration procedures and trained in our method to get the reconstruction model. The additional dozen or so testing datasets were separately obtained for evaluating the real-time performance and temperature accuracy. Acceleration factors of 1.9 and 3.7 were found for 2 times and 4 times k-space under-sampling strategies and the ResUNet-based deep learning reconstruction performed exceptionally well. In 2-fold acceleration scenario, the RMSE of temperature map patches provided the values of 0.888 degree centigrade and 1.145 degree centigrade on phantom and ex vivo testing datasets. The DICE value of temperature areas enclosed by 43 degree centigrade isotherm was 0.809, and the Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of -0.253 degree centigrade with the apart of plus or minus 2.16 degree centigrade. In 4 times under-sampling case, these evaluating values decreased by approximately 10%. This study demonstrates that deep learning-based reconstruction can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MR thermometry for clinical FUS thermal therapies.

Upon being stimulated by Terahertz (THz) frequencies that match their vibrational modes, protein molecules experience resonant absorption and dissipate their energy as heat, undergoing a thermal process. This paper aims to analyze the effect of THz signaling on the protein heat dissipation mechanism. We therefore deploy a mathematical framework based on the heat diffusion model to characterize how proteins absorb THz-electromagnetic (EM) energy from the stimulating EM fields and subsequently release this energy as heat to their immediate surroundings. We also conduct a parametric study to explain the impact of the signal power, pulse duration, and interparticle distance on the protein thermal analysis. In addition, we demonstrate the relationship between the change in temperature and the opening probability of thermally-gated ion channels. Our results indicate that a controlled temperature change can be achieved in an intra-body environment by exciting protein particles at their resonant frequencies. We further verify our results numerically using COMSOL Multiphysics and introduce an experimental framework that assesses the effects of THz radiation on protein particles. We conclude that under controlled heating, protein molecules can serve as hotspots that impact thermally-gated ion channels. Through the presented work, we infer that the heating process can be engineered on different time and length scales by controlling the THz-EM signal input.

In this direction of research, this work introduces a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) designed to learn the unknown parameters of an interpretable wildfire spreading model. The considered modeling approach integrates fundamental physical laws articulated by key model parameters essential for capturing the complex behavior of wildfires. The proposed machine learning framework leverages the theory of artificial neural networks with the physical constraints governing wildfire dynamics, including the first principles of mass and energy conservation. Training of the PiNN for physics-informed parameter identification is realized using synthetic data on the spatiotemporal evolution of one- and two-dimensional firefronts, derived from a high-fidelity simulator, as well as empirical data (ground surface thermal images) from the Troy Fire that occurred on June 19, 2002, in California. The parameter learning results demonstrate the predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in uncovering the unknown coefficients of the wildfire model in one- and two-dimensional fire spreading scenarios as well as the Troy Fire. Additionally, this methodology exhibits robustness by identifying the same parameters even in the presence of noisy data. By integrating this PiNN approach into a comprehensive framework, the envisioned physics-informed digital twin will enhance intelligent wildfire management and risk assessment, providing a powerful tool for proactive and reactive strategies.

EESMs are desired for EVs due to their high performance, efficiency, and durability at a relatively low cost. Therefore, obtaining precise EESM temperature estimations are significantly important, because online accurate temperature estimation can lead to EESM performance improvement and guaranteeing its safety and reliability. In this study, in addition to the default inputs' data, EESM losses data is leveraged to improve the performance of the proposed ML approach for thermal modeling. Exponentially weighted moving averages and standard deviations of the inputs are also incorporated in the learning process to consider the memory effect for modeling a dynamical thermal model. Using the experimental data of an EESM prototype, the performance of ordinary least squares (OLS) method is evaluated through a complete training, testing and cross-validation process. Finally, simulation results will provide the key performance metrics of OLS for EESM thermal modeling.

Vision-based maritime surveillance is challenging mainly due to visibility issues at night, which results in failures in re-identifying vessels and detecting suspicious activities. In this paper, we introduce a thermal, vision-based approach for maritime surveillance with object tracking, vessel re-identification, and suspicious activity detection capabilities. For vessel re-identification, we propose a novel viewpoint-independent algorithm which compares features of the sides of the vessel separately (separate side-spaces) leveraging shape information in the absence of color features. We propose techniques to adapt tracking and activity detection algorithms for the thermal domain and train them using a thermal dataset we created. This dataset will be the first publicly available benchmark dataset for thermal maritime surveillance. Our system is capable of re-identifying vessels with an 81.8% Top1 score and identifying suspicious activities with a 72.4\% frame mAP score; a new benchmark for each task in the thermal domain.

Measurement of this workload in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is often done using the Nursing Activities Score (NAS), but this is usually recorded manually and sporadically. Previous work has made use of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) by using computer vision to passively derive caregiver-patient interaction times to monitor staff workload. In this letter, we propose using a Multiscale Vision Transformer (MViT) to passively predict the NAS from low-resolution thermal videos recorded in an ICU. 458 videos were obtained from an ICU in Melbourne, Australia and used to train a MViTv2 model using an indirect prediction and a direct prediction method. The indirect method predicted 1 of 8 potentially identifiable NAS activities from the video before inferring the NAS. The direct method predicted the NAS score immediately from the video. The indirect method yielded an average 5-fold accuracy of 57.21%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of 0.865, a F1 score of 0.570 and a mean squared error (MSE) of 28.16. The direct method yielded a MSE of 18.16. We also showed that the MViTv2 outperforms similar models such as R(2+1)D and ResNet50-LSTM under identical settings.
  This study shows the feasibility of using a MViTv2 to passively predict the NAS in an ICU and monitor staff workload automatically. Our results above also show an increased accuracy in predicting NAS directly versus predicting NAS indirectly. We hope that our study can provide a direction for future work and further improve the accuracy of passive NAS monitoring.

To maximize the effectiveness of such energy storage, determining the appropriate charging and discharging amounts for each time period is crucial. Reinforcement learning is preferred over traditional optimization for the control of energy storage due to its ability to adapt to dynamic and complex environments. However, the continuous nature of charging and discharging levels in energy storage poses limitations for discrete reinforcement learning, and time-varying feasible charge-discharge range based on state of charge (SoC) variability also limits the conventional continuous reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a continuous reinforcement learning approach that takes into account the time-varying feasible charge-discharge range. An additional objective function was introduced for learning the feasible action range for each time period, supplementing the objectives of training the actor for policy learning and the critic for value learning. This actively promotes the utilization of energy storage by preventing them from getting stuck in suboptimal states, such as continuous full charging or discharging. This is achieved through the enforcement of the charging and discharging levels into the feasible action range. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method further maximized the effectiveness of energy storage by actively enhancing its utilization.

Equilibrium propagation has shown good performance on a number of benchmark tasks. Here we extend equilibrium propagation in two directions. First we show that there is a natural quantum generalization of equilibrium propagation in which a quantum neural network is taken to be in the ground state (more generally any eigenstate) of the network Hamiltonian, with a similar training mechanism that exploits the fact that the mean energy is extremal on eigenstates. Second we extend the analysis of equilibrium propagation at finite temperature, showing that thermal fluctuations allow one to naturally train the network without having to clamp the output layer during training. We also study the low temperature limit of equilibrium propagation.

Turbulence causes distortions, blurring, and noise in images by bending and scattering light rays due to variations in the refractive index of air. This results in non-rigid geometric distortions and temporal fluctuations in the electromagnetic radiation received by optical systems. This paper explores the effectiveness of turbulence image augmentation techniques in improving the accuracy and robustness of thermal-adapted and deep learning-based object detection models under atmospheric turbulence. Three distinct approximation-based turbulence simulators (geometric, Zernike-based, and P2S) are employed to generate turbulent training and test datasets. The performance of three state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection models: RTMDet-x, DINO-4scale, and YOLOv8-x, is employed on these turbulent datasets with and without turbulence augmentation during training. The results demonstrate that utilizing turbulence-specific augmentations during model training can significantly improve detection accuracy and robustness against distorted turbulent images. Turbulence augmentation enhances performance even for a non-turbulent test set.

However, characterizing light and its sources through single photon measurements often requires efficient detectors and longer measurement times to obtain high-quality photon statistics. Here we introduce a deep learning-based variational autoencoder (VAE) method for classifying single photon added coherent state (SPACS), single photon added thermal state (SPACS), mixed states between coherent/SPACS and thermal/SPATS of light. Our semisupervised learning-based VAE efficiently maps the photon statistics features of light to a lower dimension, enabling quasi-instantaneous classification with low average photon counts. The proposed VAE method is robust and maintains classification accuracy in the presence of losses inherent in an experiment, such as finite collection efficiency, non-unity quantum efficiency, finite number of detectors, etc. Additionally, leveraging the transfer learning capabilities of VAE enables successful classification of data of any quality using a single trained model. We envision that such a deep learning methodology will enable better classification of quantum light and light sources even in the presence of poor detection quality.

A considerable portion of building energy consumption stems from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and thus implementing smart, energy-efficient HVAC systems has the potential to significantly impact the course of climate change. In recent years, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been increasingly assessed for this purpose due to their ability to learn and adapt purely from experience. They have been shown to outperform classical controllers in terms of energy cost and consumption, as well as thermal comfort. However, their weakness lies in their relatively poor data efficiency, requiring long periods of training to reach acceptable policies, making them inapplicable to real-world controllers directly. In this paper, we demonstrate that using federated learning to train the reinforcement learning controller of HVAC systems can improve the learning speed, as well as improve their ability to generalize, which in turn facilitates transfer learning to unseen building environments. In our setting, a global control policy is learned by aggregating local policies trained on multiple data centers located in different climate zones. The goal of the policy is to minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. We perform experiments evaluating three different optimizers for local policy training, as well as three different federated learning algorithms against two alternative baselines. Our experiments show that these effects lead to a faster learning speed, as well as greater generalization capabilities in the federated policy compared to any individually trained policy. Furthermore, the learning stability is significantly improved, with the learning process and performance of the federated policy being less sensitive to the choice of parameters and the inherent randomness of reinforcement learning.

We applied our method to study the phase transitions (PT) in the Ising and XY models, and showed that the direct-sampling simulation of our model is as accurate as the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, but more efficient. Moreover, our method can give thermodynamic quantities as differentiable functions of temperature akin to an analytical solution. The free energy aligns closely with the exact one to the second-order derivative, so this inclusion of temperature dependence enables the otherwise biased variational model to capture the subtle thermal effects at the PTs.

In this paper, machine learning (ML) based prediction of Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) thermal behavior during charge-discharge operation has been demonstrated for the first time. Considering different currents with a specified electrolyte flow rate, the temperature of a kW scale VRFB system is studied through experiments. Three different ML algorithms; Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) have been used for the prediction work. The training and validation of ML algorithms have been done by the practical dataset of a 1kW 6kWh VRFB storage under 40A, 45A, 50A and 60A charge-discharge currents and 10 L min-1 of flow rate. A comparative analysis among the ML algorithms is done in terms of performance metrics such as correlation coefficient (R2), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). It is observed that XGBoost shows the highest accuracy in prediction of around 99%. The ML based prediction results obtained in this work can be very useful for controlling the VRFB temperature rise during operation and act as indicator for further development of an optimized thermal management system.

Thermal radiation information is mainly expressed through image intensities, while texture details are typically expressed through image gradients. However, existing dual-discriminator generative adversarial networks (GANs) often rely on two structurally identical discriminators for learning, which do not fully account for the distinct learning needs of infrared and visible image information. To this end, this paper proposes a novel GAN with a heterogeneous dual-discriminator network and an attention-based fusion strategy (GAN-HA). Specifically, recognizing the intrinsic differences between infrared and visible images, we propose, for the first time, a novel heterogeneous dual-discriminator network to simultaneously capture thermal radiation information and texture details. The two discriminators in this network are structurally different, including a salient discriminator for infrared images and a detailed discriminator for visible images. They are able to learn rich image intensity information and image gradient information, respectively. In addition, a new attention-based fusion strategy is designed in the generator to appropriately emphasize the learned information from different source images, thereby improving the information representation ability of the fusion result. In this way, the fused images generated by GAN-HA can more effectively maintain both the salience of thermal targets and the sharpness of textures. Extensive experiments on various public datasets demonstrate the superiority of GAN-HA over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms while showcasing its higher potential for practical applications.

HyTI science requires that the pointing accuracy of the optical axis shall not exceed 2.89 arcsec over the 0.5 ms integration time due to microvibration effects (known as jitter). Two sources of vibration are a cryocooler that is added to maintain the detector at 68 K and three orthogonally placed reaction wheels that are a part of the attitude control system. Both of these parts will introduce vibrations that are propagated through to the satellite structure while imaging. Typical methods of characterizing and measuring jitter involve complex finite element methods and specialized equipment and setups. In this paper, we describe a novel method of characterizing jitter for small satellite systems that is low-cost and minimally modifies the subject's mass distribution. The metrology instrument is comprised of a laser source, a small mirror mounted via a 3D printed clamp to a jig, and a lateral effect position-sensing detector. The position-sensing detector samples 1000 Hz and can measure displacements as little as 0.15 arcsec at distances of one meter. This paper provides an experimental procedure that incrementally analyzes vibratory sources to establish causal relationships between sources and the vibratory modes they create. We demonstrate the capabilities of this metrology system and testing procedure on HyTI in the Hawaii Space Flight Lab's clean room.

However, TECs present significant trade-offs among spatial cooling, heating and power consumption. The optimization of TECs requires extensive simulations, which are impractical for managing actual systems with multiple hotspots under spatial and temporal variations. In this study, we present a novel machine learning-assisted optimization algorithm for thermoelectric coolers that can achieve global optimal temperature by individually controlling TEC units based on real-time multi-hotspot conditions across the entire domain. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a combination of the Inception module and multi-task learning (MTL) approach to comprehend the coupled thermal-electrical physics underlying the system and attain accurate predictions for both temperature and power consumption with and without TECs. Due to the intricate interaction among passive thermal gradient, Peltier effect and Joule effect, a local optimal TEC control experiences spatial temperature trade-off which may not lead to a global optimal solution. To address this issue, we develop a backtracking-based optimization algorithm using the machine learning model to iterate all possible TEC assignments for attaining global optimal solutions. For any m by n matrix with NHS hotspots (n, m <= 10, 0<= NHS <= 20), our algorithm is capable of providing 52.4% peak temperature reduction and its corresponding TEC array control within an average of 1.64 seconds while iterating through tens of temperature predictions behind-the-scenes. This represents a speed increase of over three orders of magnitude compared to traditional FEM strategies which take approximately 27 minutes.

We create and validate an EV simulation model that incorporates door-opening scenarios. Three controllers are compared using the simulation model: (i) a hierarchical non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) with a unique coolant dividing layer and a component for cabin air inflow regulation based on door-opening signals; (ii) a single MPC controller; and (iii) a rule-based controller. The hierarchical controller outperforms, reducing door-opening temperature drops by 46.96% and 51.33% compared to single layer MPC and rule-based methods in the relevant section. Additionally, our strategy minimizes the maximum temperature gaps between the sections during recovery by 86.4% and 78.7%, surpassing single layer MPC and rule-based approaches, respectively. We believe that this result opens up future possibilities for incorporating the thermal comfort of passengers across all sections within the vehicle.

The system is based on a hybrid scheme which allows the robot to not only localize in a pre-built map, but concurrently perform simultaneous localization and mapping to explore unknown scenes, and build extended maps aligned with the existing map. Our framework has been developed for the task of autonomous ground inspection of high-voltage electrical substations residing in rough terrain.

Yet, it remains hindered by two major challenges: 1) the trade-off between performance and efficiency; 2) the scarcity of training data. To address the latter challenge, some recent methods employ prompts to fine-tune pre-trained RGB tracking models and leverage upstream knowledge in a parameter-efficient manner. However, these methods inadequately explore modality-independent patterns and disregard the dynamic reliability of different modalities in open scenarios. We propose M3PT, a novel RGB-T prompt tracking method that leverages middle fusion and multi-modal and multi-stage visual prompts to overcome these challenges. We pioneer the use of the adjustable middle fusion meta-framework for RGB-T tracking, which could help the tracker balance the performance with efficiency, to meet various demands of application. Furthermore, based on the meta-framework, we utilize multiple flexible prompt strategies to adapt the pre-trained model to comprehensive exploration of uni-modal patterns and improved modeling of fusion-modal features in diverse modality-priority scenarios, harnessing the potential of prompt learning in RGB-T tracking. Evaluating on 6 existing challenging benchmarks, our method surpasses previous state-of-the-art prompt fine-tuning methods while maintaining great competitiveness against excellent full-parameter fine-tuning methods, with only 0.34M fine-tuned parameters.

In this research, we focus on the detection of overheating anomalies using photodiode sensor data. Photodiode sensors can collect high-frequency data from the melt pool, reflecting the process dynamics and thermal history. Hence, the proposed method offers a machine learning (ML) framework to utilize photodiode sensor data for layer-wise detection of overheating anomalies. In doing so, three sets of features are extracted from the raw photodiode data: MSMM (mean, standard deviation, median, maximum), MSQ (mean, standard deviation, quartiles), and MSD (mean, standard deviation, deciles). These three datasets are used to train several ML classifiers. Cost-sensitive learning is used to handle the class imbalance between the "anomalous" layers (affected by overheating) and "nominal" layers in the benchmark dataset. To boost detection accuracy, our proposed ML framework involves utilizing the majority voting ensemble (MVE) approach. The proposed method is demonstrated using a case study including an open benchmark dataset of photodiode measurements from an LPBF specimen with deliberate overheating anomalies at some layers. The results from the case study demonstrate that the MSD features yield the best performance for all classifiers, and the MVE classifier (with a mean F1-score of 0.8654) surpasses the individual ML classifiers. Moreover, our machine learning methodology achieves superior results (9.66% improvement in mean F1-score) in detecting layer-wise overheating anomalies, surpassing the existing methods in the literature that use the same benchmark dataset.

This approach finds a compelling application in predicting melt pool geometry for laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED). One major challenge in using MF surrogates to merge a hierarchy of melt pool models is the variability in input spaces. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach for constructing an MF surrogate for predicting melt pool geometry by integrating models of varying complexity, that operate on heterogeneous input spaces. The first thermal model incorporates five input parameters i.e., laser power, scan velocity, powder flow rate, carrier gas flow rate, and nozzle height. In contrast, the second thermal model can only handle laser power and scan velocity. A mapping is established between the heterogeneous input spaces so that the five-dimensional space can be morphed into a pseudo two-dimensional space. Predictions are then blended using a Gaussian process-based co-kriging method. The resulting heterogeneous multi-fidelity Gaussian process (Het-MFGP) surrogate not only improves predictive accuracy but also offers computational efficiency by reducing evaluations required from the high-dimensional, high-fidelity thermal model. The results underscore the benefits of employing Het-MFGP for modeling melt pool behavior in L-DED. The framework successfully demonstrates how to leverage multimodal data and handle scenarios where certain input parameters may be difficult to model or measure.

We apply a Bayesian estimation approach that takes into account measurement errors and limited prior information of system properties. The approach intertwines system simulation and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We investigate the impact of assuming different model classes - cubic polynomials and piecewise linear functions - their parametrization, and different types of prior information - ranging from uninformative to informative. Piecewise linear functions require more parameters (conductivity values) to be estimated than the four parameters (coefficients or conductivity values) needed for cubic polynomials. The former model class is more flexible, but the latter requires less MCMC samples. While parametrizing polynomials with coefficients may feel more natural, it turns out that parametrizing them using conductivity values is far more natural for the specification of prior information. Robust estimation is possible for all model classes and parametrizations, as long as the prior information is accurate or not too informative. Gaussian Markov random field priors are especially well-suited for piecewise linear functions.

A recent focus in this domain is $Î_T$ noise, which arises due to a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. This paper investigates $Î_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions with insulators, where the average charge current is zero at zero voltage bias, through the measurement of quantum shot noise, i.e., $Î_T$ noise. Notably, we find that the $Î_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor junctions is significantly larger than in metal-insulator-metal junctions. Furthermore, our results reveal that $Î_T$ noise initially increases with barrier strength, peaks, and then decreases, while it shows a steady increase with temperature bias, highlighting the nuanced interplay between barrier characteristics and thermal gradients.

The model was trained to approximately satisfy the three-dimensional heat conduction law by simultaneously predicting subsurface temperature, surface heat flow, and rock thermal conductivity. In addition to bottomhole temperature measurements, we incorporated other physical quantities as model inputs, such as depth, geographic coordinates, elevation, sediment thickness, magnetic anomaly, gravity anomaly, gamma-ray flux of radioactive elements, seismicity, and electric conductivity. We constructed surface heat flow, and temperature and thermal conductivity predictions for depths of 0-7 km at an interval of 1 km with spatial resolution of 18 km$^2$ per grid cell. Our model showed superior temperature, surface heat flow and thermal conductivity mean absolute errors of 4.8Â° C, 5.817 mW/m$^2$ and 0.022 W/(C-m)$, respectively. The predictions were visualized in two-dimensional spatial maps across the modeled depths. This thorough modeling of the Earth's thermal processes is crucial to understanding subsurface phenomena and exploiting natural underground resources.

In noisy and weak-signal environments such as thermal imaging for night vision applications, however, the performance of neural computing tasks faces a significant bottleneck due to the inherent degradation of data quality upon noisy detection. Here, we propose a concept of optical signal processing before detection to address this issue. We demonstrate that spatially redistributing optical signals through a properly designed linear transformer can enhance the detection noise resilience of visual perception tasks, as benchmarked with the MNIST classification. Our idea is supported by a quantitative analysis detailing the relationship between signal concentration and noise robustness, as well as its practical implementation in an incoherent imaging system. This compute-first detection scheme can pave the way for advancing infrared machine vision technologies widely used for industrial and defense applications.

The 'natural' factors that can cause bit-flips are replicable through targeted attacks that result in significant compromises, including full privileged system access. Existing physical defense solutions have consistently been circumvented shortly after deployment. We will explore the concept of a novel software-based low-level layer that can protect vulnerable memory targeted by physical attack vectors related to bit-flip vulnerabilities.

Firstly, we innovatively redefine the role of individuals in the control loop, establishing a model for users' thermal comfort and constructing discomfort signals based on individual preferences. Unlike traditional temperature-centric approaches, "thermal comfort control" prioritizes personalized comfort. Then, considering the diversity among users, we propose a novel method to determine the optimal indoor temperature range, thus minimizing discomfort for various users and reducing building energy consumption. Finally, the efficacy of the "thermal comfort control" approach is substantiated through simulations conducted using Matlab.

In the presence of phase transition, interfacial physics are governed by molecular interaction on a microscopic scale, beyond the scope of the macroscopic continuum model in the bulk phases. The developed two-phase Riemann solvers tackle this multi-scale problem, by incorporating a local thermodynamic model to predict the interfacial entropy production. Using phenomenological relations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, interfacial mass and heat fluxes are derived from the entropy production and provide closure at the phase boundary. We employ the proposed Riemann solvers in an efficient sharp interface level-set Ghost-Fluid framework to provide coupling conditions at phase interfaces under phase transition. As a single-phase benchmark, a Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection is studied to compare the hyperbolic thermal relaxation formulation of the GPR model against the hyperbolic-parabolic Euler-Fourier system. The novel interfacial Riemann solvers are validated against molecular dynamics simulations of evaporating shock tubes with the Lennard-Jones shifted and truncated potential. On a macroscopic scale, evaporating shock tubes are computed for the material n-Dodecane and compared against Euler-Fourier results. Finally, the efficiency and robustness of the scheme is demonstrated with shock-droplet interaction simulations that involve both phase transfer and surface tension, while featuring severe interface deformations.

Accordingly, lithium-ion batteries modeling, battery heat generation, and thermal management are the main focus of researchers and car manufacturers. To fulfill the need of manufacturers in the design process, a faster model than time-consuming Computational Fluid Dynamics models (CFD) is required. Reduced Order Models (ROM) address this requirement to maintain the accuracy of CFD models while could be compiled faster. Linear Time Invariant (LTI) reduced order model has been used in the literature; however, due to the limitation of LTI system, considering the constant flow rate for the cooling fluid, a Linear Parameter Varying system with three scheduling parameters was developed in this study. It is shown that LPV system results could fit accurately to CFD results in conditions that LTI system cannot maintain accuracy. Moreover, it is shown that applying varying water flow rates could result in a smoother temperature profile.

Their accuracy is mostly determined by the spatial interpolant used to reconstruct the pair of Riemann states at cell interfaces and by the Riemann solver that computes the interface fluxes. In most Godunov-type methods, these two steps can be treated independently, so that many different schemes can in principle be built from the same numerical framework. In this work, we use our fully compressible Seven-League Hydro (SLH) code to test the accuracy of six reconstruction methods and three approximate Riemann solvers on two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) problems involving subsonic flows only. We consider Mach numbers in the range from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-1}$ in a well-posed, 2D, Kelvin--Helmholtz instability problem and a 3D turbulent convection zone that excites internal gravity waves in an overlying stable layer. We find that (i) there is a spread of almost four orders of magnitude in computational cost per fixed accuracy between the methods tested in this study, with the most performant method being a combination of a "low-dissipation" Riemann solver and a sextic reconstruction scheme, (ii) the low-dissipation solver always outperforms conventional Riemann solvers on a fixed grid when the reconstruction scheme is kept the same, (iii) in simulations of turbulent flows, increasing the order of spatial reconstruction reduces the characteristic dissipation length scale achieved on a given grid even if the overall scheme is only second order accurate, (iv) reconstruction methods based on slope-limiting techniques tend to generate artificial, high-frequency acoustic waves during the evolution of the flow, (v) unlimited reconstruction methods introduce oscillations in the thermal stratification near the convective boundary, where the entropy gradient is steep.

However, the difficulty of this analysis increases significantly with the complexity of the theoretical model and the number of material parameters for perovskite. Here we use Bayesian optimization to develop an analysis platform that can extract up to 8 fundamental material parameters of an organometallic perovskite semiconductor from a transient photoluminescence experiment, based on a complex full physics model that includes drift-diffusion of carriers and dynamic defect occupation. An example study of thermal degradation reveals that the carrier mobility and trap-assisted recombination coefficient are reduced noticeably, while the defect energy level remains nearly unchanged. The reduced carrier mobility can dominate the overall effect on thermal degradation of perovskite solar cells by reducing the fill factor, despite the opposite effect of the reduced trap-assisted recombination coefficient on increasing the fill factor. In future, this platform can be conveniently applied to other experiments or to combinations of experiments, accelerating materials discovery and optimization of semiconductor materials for photovoltaics and other applications.

Nevertheless, honey is susceptible to adulteration, a situation that has substantial consequences for both the well-being of the general population and the financial well-being of a country. Conventional approaches for detecting honey adulteration are often associated with extensive time requirements and restricted sensitivity. This paper presents a novel approach to address the aforementioned issue by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of honey samples based on thermal images. The use of thermal imaging technique offers a significant advantage in detecting adulterants, as it can reveal differences in temperature in honey samples caused by variations in sugar composition, moisture levels, and other substances used for adulteration. To establish a meticulous approach to categorizing honey, a thorough dataset comprising thermal images of authentic and tainted honey samples was collected. Several state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were trained and optimized using the dataset that was gathered. Within this set of models, there exist pre-trained models such as InceptionV3, Xception, VGG19, and ResNet that have exhibited exceptional performance, achieving classification accuracies ranging from 88% to 98%. Furthermore, we have implemented a more streamlined and less complex convolutional neural network (CNN) model, outperforming comparable models with an outstanding accuracy rate of 99%. This simplification offers not only the sole advantage of the model, but it also concurrently offers a more efficient solution in terms of resources and time. This approach offers a viable way to implement quality control measures in the honey business, so guaranteeing the genuineness and safety of this valuable organic commodity.

State-of-the-art methods often incorporate additional information, such as depth, thermal, or angular data, to enhance performance. However, light field-based face recognition approaches that leverage angular information face computational limitations. This paper investigates the fundamental trade-off between spatio-angular resolution in light field representation to achieve improved face recognition performance. By utilizing macro-pixels with varying angular resolutions while maintaining the overall image size, we aim to quantify the impact of angular information at the expense of spatial resolution, while considering computational constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate a notable performance improvement in face recognition systems by increasing the angular resolution, up to a certain extent, at the cost of spatial resolution.

While most of the PINN algorithms in the literature minimize the local residual of the governing equations, there are energy-based approaches that take a different path by minimizing the variational energy of the model. We show that in the case of the steady thermal equation weakly coupled to magnetic equation, the energy-based approach displays multiple advantages compared to the standard residual-based PINN: it is more computationally efficient, it requires a lower order of derivatives to compute, and it involves less hyperparameters. The analyzed benchmark problems are the single- and multi-objective optimal design of an inductor for the controlled heating of a graphite plate. The optimized device is designed involving a multi-physics problem: a time-harmonic magnetic problem and a steady thermal problem. For the former, a deep neural network solving the direct problem is supervisedly trained on Finite Element Analysis (FEA) data. In turn, the solution of the latter relies on a hypernetwork that takes as input the inductor geometry parameters and outputs the model weights of an energy-based PINN (or ePINN). Eventually, the ePINN predicts the temperature field within the graphite plate.

In Northern Europe heating energy alone accounts for up to 70 percent of the total building energy consumption. Industry 4.0 technologies such as IoT, big data, cloud computing and machine learning, along with the creation of predictive and proactive digital twins, can help to reduce this number. However, buildings thermal dynamics is a very complex process that depends on many variables. As a result, commonly used physics-based white box models are time-consuming and require vast expertise. On the contrary, black box forecasting models, which rely primarily on building energy consumption data, lack fundamental insights and hinder re-use. In this study we propose an architecture to facilitate grey box modelling of building thermal dynamics while integrating real time IoT data with 3D representation of buildings. The architecture is validated in a case study creating a digital twin platform that enables users to define the thermal dynamics of buildings based on physical laws and real data, thus facilitating informed decision making for the best heating energy optimization strategy. Also, the created user interface enables stakeholders such as facility managers, energy providers or governing bodies to analyse, compare and evaluate buildings thermal dynamics without extensive expertise or time resources.

Inspired by airfoil icing studies, we consider a system featuring an injection boundary inducing domain changes and a free boundary separating phases, resulting in two types of moving boundaries. Our proposed enthalpy-based formulation seamlessly integrates thermal diffusion across the domain with energy fluxes at the boundaries, addressing a modified injection condition for boundary movement. Uncertainty then stems from random variations in the injection boundary. The primary focus of our Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) centers on investigating the effects of uncertainty on free boundary propagation. Through mapping to a reference domain, we derive an enthalpy-based numerical scheme tailored to the transformed coordinate system, facilitating a simple and efficient simulation. Numerical and UQ studies in one and two dimensions validate the proposed model and the extended enthalpy method. They offer intriguing insights into ice accretion and other multiphysics processes involving phase transitions.

However, in doing so, a bias is introduced toward the SSIM and, consequently, the input visual band image. The objective of this study is to propose a novel methodology for the image fusion problem that mitigates the limitations associated with using classical evaluation metrics as loss functions. Our approach integrates a transformer-based multi-scale fusion strategy that adeptly addresses local and global context information. This integration not only refines the individual components of the image fusion process but also significantly enhances the overall efficacy of the method. Our proposed method follows a two-stage training approach, where an auto-encoder is initially trained to extract deep features at multiple scales in the first stage. For the second stage, we integrate our fusion block and change the loss function as mentioned. The multi-scale features are fused using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. The CNNs are utilized to capture local features, while the Transformer handles the integration of general context features. Through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, our proposed method, along with the novel loss function definition, demonstrates superior performance compared to other competitive fusion algorithms.

Data-driven approaches based on neural networks have been proposed to facilitate system modelling. However, such approaches are generally nonconvex and result in computationally intractable optimization problems. In this work, we design a readily implementable energy management method for small commercial buildings. We then leverage our approach to formulate a real-time demand bidding strategy. We propose a data-driven and mixed-integer convex MPC which is solved via derivative-free optimization given a limited computational time of 5 minutes to respect operational constraints. We consider rooftop unit heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems with discrete controls to accurately model the operation of most commercial buildings. Our approach uses an input convex recurrent neural network to model the thermal dynamics. We apply our approach in several demand response (DR) settings, including a demand bidding, a time-of-use, and a critical peak rebate program. Controller performance is evaluated on a state-of-the-art building simulation. The proposed approach improves thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption and cost through DR participation, when compared to other data-driven approaches or a set-point controller.

The simulation of such models plays an important role in many applications such as hydraulic stimulation in deep geothermal systems and assessing induced seismic risks in CO2 storage. We first extend to the mixed-dimensional framework the thermodynamically consistent THM models derived in [16] based on first and second principles of thermodynamics. Two formulations of the energy equation will be considered based either on energy conservation or on the entropy balance, assuming a vanishing thermo-poro-elastic dissipation. Our focus is on space time discretisations preserving energy estimates for both types of formulations and for a general single phase fluid thermodynamical model. This is achieved by a Finite Volume discretisation of the non-isothermal flow based on coercive fluxes and a tailored discretisation of the non-conservative convective terms. It is combined with a mixed Finite Element formulation of the contact-mechanical model with face-wise constant Lagrange multipliers accounting for the surface tractions, which preserves the dissipative properties of the contact terms. The discretisations of both THM formulations are investigated and compared in terms of convergence, accuracy and robustness on 2D test cases. It includes a Discrete Fracture Matrix model with a convection dominated thermal regime, and either a weakly compressible liquid or a highly compressible gas thermodynamical model.

By rescaling the temperature proportionally to the computational cell size $Îx$ ($T \to T\,Îx/a_{\text{eff}}$, where $a_{\text{eff}}$ is the lattice constant) [M. B. Hahn, J. Phys. Comm., 3:075009, 2019], we obtain Curie temperatures $T_{\text{C}}$ that are in line with the experimental values for cobalt, iron and nickel. For finite-sized objects such as nanowires (1D) and nanolayers (2D), the Curie temperature varies with the smallest size $d$ of the system. We show that the difference between the computed finite-size $T_{\text{C}}$ and the bulk $T_{\text{C}}$ follows a power-law of the type: $(Î¾_0/d)^Î»$, where $Î¾_0$ is the correlation length at zero temperature, and $Î»$ is a critical exponent. We obtain values of $Î¾_0$ in the nanometer range, also in accordance with other simulations and experiments. The computed critical exponent is close to $Î»=2$ for all considered materials and geometries. This is the expected result for a mean-field approach, but slightly larger than the values observed experimentally.

There they encounter domestic animals, farm animals, working animals, and wild animals. These creatures could be disturbed, displaced, injured, or killed by the machines. Within the context of machine ethics and social robotics, the School of Business FHNW developed several design studies and prototypes for animal-friendly machines, which can be understood as moral and social machines in the spirit of these disciplines. In 2019-20, a team led by the main author developed a prototype robot lawnmower that can recognize hedgehogs, interrupt its work for them and thus protect them.

Two crucial data sources for public security are the thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing multi-scenario photos and videos produced by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to the small scale of the target, complex scene information, low resolution relative to the viewable videos, and dearth of publicly available labeled datasets and training models, their object detection procedure is still difficult. A UAV TIR object detection framework for pictures and videos is suggested in this study. The Forward-looking Infrared (FLIR) cameras used to gather ground-based TIR photos and videos are used to create the ``You Only Look Once'' (YOLO) model, which is based on CNN architecture. Results indicated that in the validating task, detecting human object had an average precision at IOU (Intersection over Union) = 0.5, which was 72.5\%, using YOLOv7 (YOLO version 7) state of the art model \cite{1}, while the detection speed around 161 frames per second (FPS/second). The usefulness of the YOLO architecture is demonstrated in the application, which evaluates the cross-detection performance of people in UAV TIR videos under a YOLOv7 model in terms of the various UAVs' observation angles. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation of object detection from TIR pictures and videos using deep-learning models is supported favorably by this work.

Reliable continuous operation of NN is essential for safety-critical applications. During online operation, NNs are susceptible to single and multiple permanent and soft errors due to factors such as radiation, aging, and thermal effects. Explicit NN-HA testing methods cannot detect transient faults during inference, are unsuitable for always-on applications, and require extensive test vector generation and storage. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the \emph{uncertainty fingerprint} approach representing the online fault status of NN. Furthermore, we propose a dual head NN topology specifically designed to produce uncertainty fingerprints and the primary prediction of the NN in \emph{a single shot}. During the online operation, by matching the uncertainty fingerprint, we can concurrently self-test NNs with up to $100\%$ coverage with a low false positive rate while maintaining a similar performance of the primary task. Compared to existing works, memory overhead is reduced by up to $243.7$ MB, multiply and accumulate (MAC) operation is reduced by up to $10000\times$, and false-positive rates are reduced by up to $89\%$.

This study presents a machine learning approach using Random Forest (RF) models to map stem water potential (SWP) by integrating high-resolution multispectral remote sensing imagery from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights with weather data. From 2017 to 2018, five flights of an UAV equipped with a seven-band multispectral camera were conducted over a commercial walnut orchard, paired with concurrent ground measurements of sampled walnut plants. The RF regression model, utilizing vegetation indices derived from orthomosaiced UAV imagery and weather data, effectively estimated ground-measured SWPs, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.63 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.80 bars. The integration of weather data was particularly crucial for consolidating data across various flight dates. Significant variables for SWP estimation included wind speed and vegetation indices such as NDVI, NDRE, and PSRI.A reduced RF model excluding red-edge indices of NDRE and PSRI, demonstrated slightly reduced accuracy ($R^2$ = 0.54). Additionally, the RF classification model predicted water stress levels in walnut trees with 85% accuracy, surpassing the 80% accuracy of the reduced classification model. The results affirm the efficacy of UAV-based multispectral imaging combined with machine learning, incorporating thermal data, NDVI, red-edge indices, and weather data, in walnut water stress estimation and assessment. This methodology offers a scalable, cost-effective tool for data-driven precision irrigation management at an individual plant level in walnut orchards.

In recent years, tissue electroporation simulations have been performed using static models. However, the results of a static model simulation are restricted to a fixed protocol signature of the pulsed electric field. This paper describes a novel dynamic model of tissue electroporation that also includes tissue dispersion and temperature to allow time-domain simulations. We implemented the biological dispersion of potato tubers and thermal analysis in a commercial finite element method software. A cell electroporation model was adapted to account for the increase in tissue conductivity. The model yielded twelve parameters, divided into three dynamic states of electroporation. Thermal analysis describes the dependence of tissue conductivity on temperature. The model parameters were evaluated using experiments with vegetal tissue (Solanum tuberosum) under electrochemotherapy protocols. The proposed model can accurately predict the conductivity of tissue under electroporation from 10 kV/m to 100 kV/m. A negligible thermal effect was observed at 100 kV/m, with a 0.89 Â°C increase. We believe that the proposed model is suitable for describing the electroporation current on a tissue scale and also for providing a hint on the effects on the cell membrane.

Practically all large players in the field either already use this winding technology or have announced doing so soon. However, hairpins, bar windings, and other segmented winding techniques are not purely a material and production issue. Instead their application to small drives influences all aspects of the design of machines, which are currently explored and studied by the industry. These range from not obvious gaps in the theory, parameter studies for maxima of efficiency, possible as well as advantageous winding schemes, thermal design, and ways to control ac losses to specific materials and process difficulties. Despite the apparent novelty of the trend, however, designers could revisit a widely forgotten knowledge base of more than 100 years for many of those questions. This old knowledge base and the understanding that many recently presented concepts have been developed earlier may speed up the technological development and appear to be a key to further innovation. Instead, many problems need to be solved again and technologies re-invented. Furthermore, as this technology has recently become merely industry-driven, a substantial portion of the information and technological developments are not available to the public -- a state that to our eyes may harm the innovation capacity of the drives community.

Achieving precise personalized treatment necessitates feedback information on in situ thermal effects induced by the RFA procedure. While computer simulation facilitates the prediction of electrical and thermal phenomena associated with RFA, its practical implementation in clinical settings is hindered by high computational demands. In this paper, we propose a physics-guided neural network model, named PhysRFANet, to enable real-time prediction of thermal effect during RFA treatment. The networks, designed for predicting temperature distribution and the corresponding ablation lesion, were trained using biophysical computational models that integrated electrostatics, bio-heat transfer, and cell necrosis, alongside magnetic resonance (MR) images of breast cancer patients. Validation of the computational model was performed through experiments on ex vivo bovine liver tissue. Our model demonstrated a 96% Dice score in predicting the lesion volume and an RMSE of 0.4854 for temperature distribution when tested with foreseen tumor images. Notably, even with unforeseen images, it achieved a 93% Dice score for the ablation lesion and an RMSE of 0.6783 for temperature distribution. All networks were capable of inferring results within 10 ms.

While studies have shown that relocating same-modality tactile stimuli can influence the one perceived at the fingertip, the interaction of cross-modal tactile stimuli remains unclear. Here, we investigate how thermal cues applied on the index finger's proximal phalanx affect vibrotactile sensitivity at the fingertip of the same finger when employed at varying contact pressures. We designed a novel wearable device that can deliver thermal stimuli at adjustable contact pressures on the proximal phalanx. Utilizing this device, we measured the detection thresholds of fifteen participants for 250 Hz sinusoidal vibration applied on the fingertip while concurrently applying constant cold and warm stimuli at high and low contact pressures to the proximal phalanx. Our results revealed no significant differences in detection thresholds across conditions. These preliminary findings suggest that applying constant thermal stimuli to other skin locations does not affect fingertip vibrotactile sensitivity, possibly due to perceptual adaptation. However, the influence of dynamic multisensory tactile stimuli remains an open question for future research.

This research combines distributed optimization using ADMM with deep learning models to plan indoor temperature setpoints effectively. A two-layer hierarchical structure is used, with a central building coordinator at the upper layer and local controllers at the thermal zone layer. The coordinator must limit the building's maximum power by translating the building's total power to local power targets for each zone. Local controllers can modify the temperature setpoints to meet the local power targets. While most algorithms are either centralized or require prior knowledge about the building's structure, our approach is distributed and fully data-driven. The proposed algorithm, called Distributed Planning Networks, is designed to be both adaptable and scalable to many types of buildings, tackling two of the main challenges in the development of such systems. The proposed approach is tested on an 18-zone building modeled in EnergyPlus. The algorithm successfully manages Demand Response peak events.

We demonstrate this approach on aircraft thermal management systems (TMSs) utilizing previous datasets created using an enumeration or brute-force graph generation procedure to represent novel aircraft TMSs as graphs. However, as with many enumerative approaches, combinatorial explosion limits its efficacy in many real-world problems, particularly when simulations and optimization must be performed on the many (automatically-generated) physics models. Therefore, the approach uses the directed graphs representing aircraft TMSs and GDL to predict on a subset of the graph-based dataset through graph classification. This paper's findings demonstrate that incorporating additional graph-based features using principle component analysis (PCA) enhances GDL model performance, achieving an accuracy of 98% for determining a graph's compilability and simulatability while using only 5% of the data for training. By applying iterative classification methods, we also successfully segmented the total set of graphs into more specific groups with an average inclusion of 75.5 of the top 100 highest-performing graphs, achieved by training on 40% of the data.

However, translating methods that work well in controlled lab environments to field applications presents significant challenges, notably because of the limited diversity and accuracy of the lab training data. By enabling the use of field data, online machine learning can be a powerful tool to overcome this problem, but it introduces additional challenges in ensuring the stability and predictability of the training processes. This work presents an edge computing method that mitigates these shortcomings with minimal additional memory usage, by employing an autonomous algorithm that prioritizes the storage of training samples with larger prediction errors. The method is demonstrated on the use case of a self-commissioning condition monitoring system, in the form of a thermal anomaly detection scheme for a variable frequency motor drive, where the algorithm self-learned to distinguish normal and anomalous operation with minimal prior knowledge. The obtained results, based on experimental data, show a significant improvement in prediction accuracy and training speed, when compared to equivalent models trained online without the proposed data selection process.

The governing transport equations are stochastic partial differential equations with a fluctuating forcing term. We propose a discrete formulation of the stochastic forcing term that has the correct covariance matrix up to a standard discretization error. Furthermore, to obtain a numerical solution with spatial correlations that converge to those of the continuum equation, we derive a linear mapping to transform the finite element solution into an equivalent discrete solution that is free from the artificial correlations introduced by the spatial discretization. The method is validated by applying it to two diffusion problems: a second-order diffusion equation and a fourth-order diffusion equation. The theoretical (continuum) solution to the first case presents spatially decorrelated fluctuations, while the second case presents fluctuations correlated over a finite length. In both cases, the numerical solution presents a structure factor that approximates well the continuum one.

However, high-fidelity CHT numerical simulations are computationally intensive, which limits their applications such as design optimization, where hundreds to thousands of evaluations are required. In this work, we develop a modular deep encoder-decoder hierarchical (DeepEDH) convolutional neural network, a novel deep-learning-based surrogate modeling methodology for computationally intensive CHT analyses. Leveraging convective temperature dependencies, we propose a two-stage temperature prediction architecture that couples velocity and temperature fields. The proposed DeepEDH methodology is demonstrated by modeling the pressure, velocity, and temperature fields for a liquid-cooled cold-plate-based battery thermal management system with variable channel geometry. A computational mesh and CHT formulation of the cold plate is created and solved using the finite element method (FEM), generating a dataset of 1,500 simulations. Our performance analysis covers the impact of the novel architecture, separate DeepEDH models for each field, output geometry masks, multi-stage temperature field predictions, and optimizations of the hyperparameters and architecture. Furthermore, we quantify the influence of the CHT analysis' thermal boundary conditions on surrogate model performance, highlighting improved temperature model performance with higher heat fluxes. Compared to other deep learning neural network surrogate models, such as U-Net and DenseED, the proposed DeepEDH architecture for CHT analyses exhibits up to a 65% enhancement in the coefficient of determination $R^{2}$.

Currently, the focus of DOEs primarily revolves around active power exports of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generation, often neglecting the impact of demand response (DR). This paper presents a two-stage, coordinated approach for residential DR participation in electricity markets under the DOE framework. In the first stage, the distribution network service provider (DNSP) adopts a convex hull technique to establish DOEs at each customer point-of-connection (POC). In the second stage, the demand response aggregator (DRA) utilises DOEs assigned by the DNSP to develop a hierarchical control scheme for tracking a load set-point signal without jeopardising network statutory limits. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in a practical setting, software-in-the-loop (SIL) tests are performed in a grid simulator, considering a real residential feeder with realistic household load and generation profiles. Simulation validations suggest that the DRA can provide precise DR while honouring network statutory limits and maintaining end-user thermal comfort. Furthermore, the overall approach is compliant with the market dispatch interval and preserves end-user data privacy.

Depending on the type of data being detected, SOD can be categorized into various forms, including RGB, RGB-D (Depth), RGB-T (Thermal) and light field SOD. Previous researches have focused on saliency detection with individual data type. If the RGB-D SOD model is forced to detect RGB-T data it will perform poorly. We propose an innovative model framework that provides a unified solution for the salient object detection task of three types of data (RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T). The three types of data can be handled in one model (all in one) with the same weight parameters. In this framework, the three types of data are concatenated in an ordered manner within a single input batch, and features are extracted using a transformer network. Based on this framework, we propose an efficient lightweight SOD model, namely AiOSOD, which can detect any RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T data with high speed (780FPS for RGB data, 485FPS for RGB-D or RGB-T data). Notably, with only 6.25M parameters, AiOSOD achieves excellent performance on RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T datasets.

We approach this question at the intersection of haptics and psychology using a custom-built thermal device and emotional responses based on photos from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) library. Unlike past research, this study incorporates deception and a control (i.e., neutral temperature) condition. One hundred and twenty naive subjects reported their emotional responses to fifty-six images varying on normative arousal and valence ratings while being exposed to a cool~(30Â°C), neutral (33Â°C), or warm (36Â°C) temperature applied to the upper back. Participants exposed to warm temperatures reported higher arousal ratings in some image categories than participants exposed to neutral or cool temperatures. Valence ratings were decreased in warm conditions compared to neutral conditions. The emotion wheel was used as a complementary method of affective response measurement, and exploratory analysis methods were implemented. Although the valence and arousal showed statistical significance, the emotion wheel results did not demonstrate any significant differences between the temperature conditions.

The predictive power of the ACE potential against density functional theory (DFT) is demonstrated across a broad range of properties of w-AlN, including ground-state lattice parameters, specific heat capacity, coefficients of thermal expansion, bulk modulus, and harmonic phonon dispersions. Validation of lattice thermal conductivity is further carried out by comparing the ACE-predicted values to the DFT calculations and experiments, exhibiting the overall capability of our ACE potential in sufficiently describing anharmonic phonon interactions. As a practical application, we perform a lattice dynamics analysis using the potential to unravel the effects of biaxial strains on thermal conductivity and phonon properties of w-AlN, which is identified as a significant tuning factor for near-junction thermal design of w-AlN-based electronics.

Conducted within the transmission line framework, the analysis reveals profound interactions between traveling electromagnetic and mechanical waves in magnetizable piezoelectric beams, despite disparities in their velocities. Findings suggest that in the open-loop scenario, the interaction of heat and beam dynamics lacks exponential stability solely considering thermal effects. To confront this challenge, two types of boundary-type state feedback controllers are proposed: (i) employing static feedback controllers entirely and (ii) adopting a hybrid approach wherein the electrical controller dynamically enhances system dynamics. In both cases, solutions of the PDE systems demonstrate exponential stability through meticulously formulated Lyapunov functions with diverse multipliers. The proposed proof technique establishes a robust foundation for demonstrating the exponential stability of Finite-Difference-based model reductions as the discretization parameter approaches zero.

We assessed the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning models for thermal conductivity prediction on this expanded dataset and observed that all these models suffered from overfitting. To address this issue, we introduced a novel graph-based neural network model, which demonstrated more consistent and regularized performance across all evaluated datasets. Nevertheless, the best mean absolute percentage error achieved on the test dataset remained in the range of 50-60%. This suggests that while these models are valuable for expediting material screening, their current accuracy is still limited.

Most material recognition approaches use vibration information from a tactile exploration, typically above one second long, to identify the material. This work proposes a tactile multi-modal (vibration and thermal) material identification approach based on recursive Bayesian estimation. Through the frequency response of the vibration induced by the material and thermal features, like an estimate of the thermal power loss of the finger, we show that it is possible to identify materials in less than half a second. Moreover, a comparison between the use of vibration only and multi-modal identification shows that both recognition time and classification errors are reduced by adding thermal information.

The electromechanical inertia of large synchronous generators is currently the only resource to absorb frequency disturbances on sub-second time scales. Replacing standard thermal power plants with inertialess new renewable sources of energy (NRE) therefore jeopardizes grid stability against e.g. sudden power generation losses. To guarantee system stability and compensate the lack of electromechanical inertia in grids with large penetrations of NREs, virtual synchronous generators, that emulate conventional generators, have been proposed. Here, we propose a novel control scheme for virtual synchronous generators, where the provided inertia is large at short times -- thereby absorbing faults as efficiently as conventional generators -- but decreases over a tunable time scale to prevent coherent frequency oscillations from setting in. We evaluate the performance of this adaptive inertia scheme under sudden power losses in large-scale transmission grids. We find that it systematically outperforms conventional, electromechanical inertia and that it is more stable than previously suggested schemes. Numerical simulations show how a quasi-optimal geographical distribution of adaptive inertia devices not only absorbs local faults efficiently, but also significantly increases the damping of inter-area oscillations. Our results show that the proposed adaptive inertia control scheme is an excellent solution to strengthen grid stability in future low-inertia power grids with large penetrations of NREs.

Two-phase cooling methods enhanced by porous surfaces, which capitalize on thin-film evaporation atop structured porous surfaces, are emerging as potential solutions. In such porous structures, the optimum heat dissipation capacity relies on two competing objectives that depend on mass and heat transfer. The computational costs of evaluating these objectives, the high dimensionality of the design space which a voxelated microstructure representation, and the manufacturability constraints hinder the optimization process for thermal management. We address these challenges by developing a data-driven framework for designing optimal porous microstructures for cooling applications. In our framework we leverage spectral density functions (SDFs) to encode the design space via a handful of interpretable variables and, in turn, efficiently search it. We develop physics-based formulas to quantify the thermofluidic properties and feasibility of candidate designs via offline simulations. To decrease the reliance on expensive simulations, we generate multi-fidelity data and build emulators to find Pareto-optimal designs. We apply our approach to a canonical problem on evaporator wick design and obtain fin-like topologies in the optimal microstructures which are also characteristics often observed in industrial applications.

Carrier phase differential GPS (CDGPS) with integer ambiguity resolution (IAR) is a promising means of achieving cm-level accuracy for high-precision Rendezvous, Proximity-Operations and Docking (RPOD), In-Space Servicing, Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM) as well as satellite formation flying and swarming. However, IAR is sensitive to received GPS signal noise, especially under severe multi-path or high thermal noise. This paper proposes a sensor-fusion approach to achieve IAR under such conditions in two coupling stages. A loose coupling stage fuses through an Extended Kalman Filter the CDGPS measurements with on-board sensor measurements such as range from cross-links, and vision-based bearing angles. A second tight-coupling stage augments the cost function of the integer weighted least-squares minimization with a soft constraint function using noise-weighted observed-minus-computed residuals from these external sensor measurements. Integer acceptance tests are empirically modified to reflect added constraints. Partial IAR is applied to graduate integer fixing. These proposed techniques are packaged into flight-capable software, with ground truths simulated by the Stanford Space Rendezvous Laboratory's S3 library using state-of-the-art force modelling with relevant sources of errors, and validated in two scenarios: (1) a high multi-path scenario involving rendezvous and docking in low Earth orbit, and (2) a high thermal noise scenario relying only on GPS side-lobe signals during proximity operations in geostationary orbit. This study demonstrates successful IAR in both cases, using the proposed sensor-fusion approach, thus demonstrating potential for high-precision state estimation under adverse signal-to-noise conditions.

To design some stable numerical methods and reveal the multi-physical processes of deformation, diffusion and heat, we introduce three new variables to reformulate the original model into a fluid coupled problem. Then, we introduce an Newton's iterative algorithm by replacing the convective transport term with $\nabla T^{i}\cdot(\bm{K}\nabla p^{i-1})$, $\nabla T^{i-1}\cdot(\bm{K}\nabla p^{i})$ and $\nabla T^{i-1}\cdot(\bm{K}\nabla p^{i-1})$, and apply the Banach fixed point theorem to prove the convergence of the proposed method. Then, we propose a multiphysics finite element method with Newton's iterative algorithm, which is equivalent to a stabilized method, can effectively overcome the numerical oscillation caused by the nonlinear thermal convection term. Also, we prove that the fully discrete multiphysics finite element method has an optimal convergence order. Finally, we draw conclusions to summarize the main results of this paper.

During the training phase, the model learns about the relationship between the local structural features and the physical processes, such as the heat flux in the microstructures, due to external temperature gradients. Once trained, the model generates new structural and associated heat flux environments, bypassing the computationally expensive modeling. Our model provides a cost effective and efficient approach over conventional modeling techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM), for describing the thermal properties of microstructures. The conventional approach requires computational modeling that scales with the size of the microstructure model, therefore limiting the simulation to a given size, resolution, and complexity of the model. In contrast, the FluxGAN model uses synthesis-by-part approach and generates arbitrary large size images at low computational cost. We demonstrate that the model can be utilized to generate designs of thermal sprayed coatings that satisfies target thermal properties. Furthermore, the model is capable of generating coating microstructures and physical processes in three-dimensional (3D) domain after being trained on two-dimensional (2D) examples. Our approach has the potential to transform the design and optimization of thermal sprayed coatings for various applications, including high-temperature and long-duration operation of gas turbines for aircraft or ground-based power generators.

Recent studies on local quantum circuits reveal two exponential stages with decay rates $r_1$ and $r_2$ of the purity before and after thermalization.

We show that we can control the position of a nylon artificial muscle without external sensors. To this end, we construct a mapping from a desired displacement trajectory to a required power using an ensemble encoder-style feed-forward neural network. The neural controller is carefully trained on a physics-based denoised dataset and can be fine-tuned to accommodate various types of thermal artificial muscles, irrespective of the presence or absence of hysteresis.

Fortunately, nuclear engineering can rely on the magnetic confinement of a plasma using superconducting coils so long as the Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) is optimized. This paper will investigate some of the materials which can increase the rate at which Tritium is produced within the breeding blanket layer of Submersion Tokamak reactors, a design that uses magnetic confinement of a plasma in the shape of a torus to execute nuclear fusion. Using the Paramak Python module to model several geometries and OpenMC to run a simulation, it can be observed how neutron multipliers, enrichment, and the neutron energy spectrum affect TBR. This experiment will mainly observe different material choices that have been considered and their TBR based on their cross sections, dose rate, thermal properties and safety. By altering the neutron energy spectrum to account for DD and DT plasma, the difference in these compounds' Tritium breeding efficacy is noted. Neutron energy spectra are an important factor in optimising the TBR levels as the neutrons generated by the fusion reactions in the plasma interact with the breeder material in the blanket and produce tritium through the reaction with Lithium. Since Tritium is a rare isotope of hydrogen that is used as fuel in fusion reactions and has a short half-life, it is essential to produce tritium within the fusion reactor itself. Without the tritium breeding capability, it would not be feasible to generate energy via fusion. A TBR greater than unity indicates that the reactor can generate more tritium than it consumes, ensuring self-sufficiency in the tritium inventory. Since Tritium is the most reliable and efficient fuel for these reactors, optimising the TBR is of paramount importance in the long road to commercialization of nuclear fusion.

Typical modeling analyses are completed a priori, and provide insight for properly sizing a motor for an application, specifying the required operating voltage and current, as well as assessing the thermal response and other design attributes (e.g.transmission ratio). However, to perform these modeling analyses, proper information about the motor's characteristics are needed, which are often obtained from manufacturer datasheets. Through our own experience and communications with manufacturers, we have noticed a lack of clarity and standardization in modeling BLDC motors, compounded by vague or inconsistent terminology used in motor datasheets. The purpose of this tutorial is to concisely describe the governing equations for BLDC motor analyses used in the design process, as well as highlight potential errors that can arise from incorrect usage. We present a power-invariant conversion from phase and line-to-line reference frames to a familiar q-axis DC motor representation, which provides a ``brushed'' analogue of a three phase BLDC motor that is convenient for analysis and design. We highlight potential errors including incorrect calculations of winding resistive heat loss, improper estimation of motor torque via the motor's torque constant, and incorrect estimation of the required bus voltage or resulting angular velocity limitations. A unified and condensed set of governing equations is available for designers in the Appendix. The intent of this work is to provide a consolidated mathematical foundation for modeling BLDC motors that addresses existing confusion and fosters high performance designs of future robotic systems.

One of the project goals was to develop a safe and certifiable onboard system concept. This paper aims to present the conceptual propulsion system architecture design for an all-electric battery-powered multirotor electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicle. Therefore, a conceptual design method was developed that provides a structured approach for designing the safe multirotor propulsion architecture. Based on the concept of operation the powertrain system was initially predefined, iteratively refined based on the safety assessment and validated through component sizing and simulations. The analysis was conducted within three system groups that were developed in parallel: the drivetrain, the energy supply and the thermal management system. The design process indicated that a pure quadcopter propulsion system can merely be designed reasonably for meeting the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) reliability specifications. By adding two push propellers and implementing numerous safety as well as passivation measures the reliability specifications defined by EASA could finally be fulfilled. The subsequent system simulations also verified that the system architecture is capable of meeting the requirements of the vehicle concept of operations. However, further work is required to extend the safety analysis to additional system components as the thermal management system or the battery management system and to reduce propulsion system weight.

Liquid nitrogen was used to kill the unwanted cells via freezing. One of the challenges of cryosurgery is to destroy the complete tumor without damaging the surrounding healthy cells when the tumor is large. To overcome this challenge, multi-cryoprobes were arranged in a polygonal pattern to create a uniform cooling and optimum ablation zone in the tissue. Single, three, and four cryoprobes were placed in the center, triangle, and square patterns to analyze the temperature profile and ablation zone. The results showed that tissue will freeze quickly when cryoprobes are placed in a square pattern. After the treatment of 600 seconds, $99\%$, $96\%$, and $31\%$ of the tumor were killed using four, three, and single cryoprobes, respectively. One of the difficulties in the multi-probe technique is choosing the probe separation distance and cooling time. The volume of the ablation zone, the thermal damage to healthy cells, and the volume of tumor cells killed during the treatment for different probe separation distances of 10 mm, 15 mm, and 20 mm are analyzed. Compared to other settings, a multi-probe technique destroys the entire tumor with the least harm to healthy cells when probes are arranged in a square pattern with a 15 mm space between them.

This process can be highly intrusive and labour-intensive for large-scale implementations, limiting the practicality of real-world OCC implementations. To address this issue, this study proposes a thermal preference-based HVAC control framework enhanced with Active Learning (AL) to address the data challenges related to real-world implementations of such OCC systems. The proposed AL approach proactively identifies the most informative thermal conditions for human annotation and iteratively updates a supervised thermal comfort model. The resulting model is subsequently used to predict the occupants' thermal preferences under different thermal conditions, which are integrated into the building's HVAC controls. The feasibility of our proposed AL-enabled OCC was demonstrated in an EnergyPlus simulation of a real-world testbed supplemented with the thermal preference data of 58 study occupants. The preliminary results indicated a significant reduction in overall labelling effort (i.e., 31.0%) between our AL-enabled OCC and conventional OCC while still achieving a slight increase in energy savings (i.e., 1.3%) and thermal satisfaction levels above 98%. This result demonstrates the potential for deploying such systems in future real-world implementations, enabling personalised comfort and energy-efficient building operations.

A Multiple second order generalized integrator frequency-locked loop synchronization algorithm is employed in order to estimate the system frequency without harmonic distortions, as well as to output the positive- and the negative- sequence of the Î±\b{eta} quantities of the three-phase grid voltages when balanced and unbalanced voltage sags happen in a frequency-adaptive scheme. The current control is carried out in the stationary reference frame, which guarantees the cancellation of the harmonic distortions in the utility grid currents using a Harmonic compensation structure, and the implementation of a constant active power control in order to protect the DC link capacitor from thermal stresses avoiding the appearance of large harmonic distortions at twice the fundamental frequency in the DC link voltage. A case study of a three-phase single-stage grid-connected PV system with a maximum apparent power about 500 kVA is tested with several simulations using MATLAB/SIMULINK firstly, and secondly, with some experiments using the Controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) simulation technique for several types of voltage sags in order to do the final validation of the control algorithms.

However, due to inherent process variability, it is still very costly and time consuming to certify the process and the part. This has led researchers to conduct numerous studies in process modeling, in-situ monitoring and feedback control to better understand the PBF process and decrease variations, thereby making the process more repeatable. In this study, we develop a layer-to-layer, spatial, control-oriented thermal PBF model. This model enables a framework for capturing spatially-driven thermal effects and constructing layer-to-layer spatial controllers that do not suffer from inherent temporal delays. Further, this framework is amenable to voxel-level monitoring and characterization efforts. System output controllability is analyzed and output controllability conditions are determined. A spatial Iterative Learning Controller (ILC), constructed using the spatial modeling framework, is implemented in two experiments, one where the path and part geometry are layer-invariant and another where the path and part geometry change each layer. The results illustrate the ability of the controller to thermally regulate the entire part, even at corners that tend to overheat and even as the path and part geometry change each layer.

These machines consist of few interacting quantum bits (qubits) connected to several environments at different temperatures. Heat flows through the machine are here exploited for computing. The process starts by setting the temperatures of the environments according to the logical input. The machine evolves, eventually reaching a non-equilibrium steady state, from which the output of the computation can be determined via the temperature of an auxilliary finite-size reservoir. Such a machine, which we term a ``thermodynamic neuron'', can implement any linearly-separable function, and we discuss explicitly the cases of NOT, 3-MAJORITY and NOR gates. In turn, we show that a network of thermodynamic neurons can perform any desired function. We discuss the close connection between our model and artificial neurons (perceptrons), and argue that our model provides an alternative physics-based analogue implementation of neural networks, and more generally a platform for thermodynamic computing.

Hotspot detection is of utmost importance in industrial safety where equipment can develop anomalies. Hotspots are early indicators of such anomalies. We address the problem of hotspot detection in thermal images by proposing a self-supervised learning approach. Self-supervised learning has shown potential as a competitive alternative to their supervised learning counterparts but their application to thermography has been limited. This has been due to lack of diverse data availability, domain specific pre-trained models, standardized benchmarks, etc. We propose a self-supervised representation learning approach followed by fine-tuning that improves detection of hotspots by classification. The SimSiam network based ensemble classifier decides whether an image contains hotspots or not. Detection of hotspots is followed by precise hotspot isolation. By doing so, we are able to provide a highly accurate and precise hotspot identification, applicable to a wide range of applications. We created a novel large thermal image dataset to address the issue of paucity of easily accessible thermal images. Our experiments with the dataset created by us and a publicly available segmentation dataset show the potential of our approach for hotspot detection and its ability to isolate hotspots with high accuracy. We achieve a Dice Coefficient of 0.736, the highest when compared with existing hotspot identification techniques. Our experiments also show self-supervised learning as a strong contender of supervised learning, providing competitive metrics for hotspot detection, with the highest accuracy of our approach being 97%.

(2020) and Cremon et al. (2020), on large-scale thermal CO2 injection cases. For Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) projects, injecting CO2 under supercritical conditions is typically tens of degrees colder than the reservoir temperature. Thermal effects can have a significant impact on the simulation results, but they also add many challenges for the solvers. More specifically, the usual combination of an iterative linear solver (such as GMRES) and the Constrained Pressure Residual (CPR) physics-based block-preconditioner is known to perform rather poorly or fail to converge when thermal effects play a significant role. The Constrained Pressure-Temperature Residual (CPTR) preconditioner retains the 2x2 block structure (elliptic/hyperbolic) of CPR but includes the temperature in the elliptic subsystem. The elliptic subsystem is now formed by two equations, and is dealt with by the system-solver of BoomerAMG (from the HYPRE library). Then a global smoother, ILU(0), is applied to the full system to handle the local, hyperbolic temperature fronts. We implemented CPTR in the multi-physics solver GEOS and present results on various large-scale thermal CCS simulation cases, including both Cartesian and fully unstructured meshes, up to tens of millions of degrees of freedom. The CPTR preconditioner severely reduces the number of GMRES iterations and the runtime, with cases timing out in 24h with CPR now requiring a few hours with CPTR. We present strong scaling results using hundreds of CPU cores for multiple cases, and show close to linear scaling. CPTR is also virtually insensitive to the thermal Peclet number (which compares advection and diffusion effects) and is suitable to any thermal regime.

UAVs offer low-cost platforms with flexible hardware configurations, as well as an increasing number of autonomous capabilities, including take-off, landing, object tracking and obstacle avoidance. However, little attention has been paid to how UAVs deal with object detection uncertainties caused by false readings from vision-based detectors, data noise, vibrations, and occlusion. In most situations, the relevance and understanding of these detections are delegated to human operators, as many UAVs have limited cognition power to interact autonomously with the environment. This paper presents a framework for autonomous navigation under uncertainty in outdoor scenarios for small UAVs using a probabilistic-based motion planner. The framework is evaluated with real flight tests using a sub 2 kg quadrotor UAV and illustrated in victim finding Search and Rescue (SAR) case study in a forest/bushland. The navigation problem is modelled using a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and solved in real time onboard the small UAV using Augmented Belief Trees (ABT) and the TAPIR toolkit. Results from experiments using colour and thermal imagery show that the proposed motion planner provides accurate victim localisation coordinates, as the UAV has the flexibility to interact with the environment and obtain clearer visualisations of any potential victims compared to the baseline motion planner. Incorporating this system allows optimised UAV surveillance operations by diminishing false positive readings from vision-based object detectors.

However, current research in this field faces challenges of insufficiently realistic image quality after translation and the difficulty of existing models in adapting to unseen scenarios. In order to develop a more generalizable image translation architecture, we conducted an analysis of existing translation architectures. By exploring the interpretability of intermediate modalities in existing translation architectures, we found that the intermediate modality in the image translation process for street scene images essentially performs semantic segmentation, distinguishing street images based on background and foreground patterns before assigning color information. Based on these principles, we propose an improved algorithm based on U-net called LadleNet. This network utilizes a two-stage U-net concatenation structure, consisting of Handle and Bowl modules. The Handle module is responsible for constructing an abstract semantic space, while the Bowl module decodes the semantic space to obtain the mapped VI image. Due to the characteristic of semantic segmentation, the Handle module has strong extensibility. Therefore, we also propose LadleNet+, which replaces the Handle module in LadleNet with a pre-trained DeepLabv3+ network, enabling the model to have a more powerful capability in constructing semantic space. The proposed methods were trained and tested on the KAIST dataset, followed by quantitative and qualitative analysis. Compared to existing methods, LadleNet and LadleNet+ achieved an average improvement of 12.4% and 15.2% in SSIM metrics, and 37.9% and 50.6% in MS-SSIM metrics, respectively.

Over 1,000 datasets are collected, which is nearly one order of magnitude larger than up-to-date works. Then, a new interdisciplinary process flow is proposed. Some meaningful results are obtained that were not addressed by previous studies. It is found that Radom Forest might be a better choice for datasets larger than 1,000 due to both high accuracy and fast speed. Besides, the dataset range affects the quantified importance (weighted value) of factors significantly, with up to a 115% increment. Moreover, the results show that machine learning has a high accuracy on the extrapolation prediction of productivity, where the minimum mean relative prediction error is just around 4%. The results of this work not only show the necessity of the dataset characteristics' effect but also provide a standard process for studying solar-thermal desalination by machine learning, which would pave the way for interdisciplinary study.

Existing thermal modeling techniques often ignore the effects of parameter variation, which can lead to significant errors. Such methods also ignore the dependence of conductivity on temperature and its variation. Leakage power is also incorporated inadequately by state-of-the-art techniques. Thermal modeling is a process that has to be repeated at least thousands of times in the design cycle, and hence speed is of utmost importance.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose VarSim, an ultrafast thermal simulator based on Green's functions. Green's functions have been shown to be faster than the traditional finite difference and finite element-based approaches but have rarely been employed in thermal modeling. Hence we propose a new Green's function-based method to capture the effects of leakage power as well as process variation analytically. We provide a closed-form solution for the Green's function considering the effects of variation on the process, temperature, and thermal conductivity. In addition, we propose a novel way of dealing with the anisotropicity introduced by process variation by splitting the Green's functions into shift-variant and shift-invariant components. Since our solutions are analytical expressions, we were able to obtain speedups that were several orders of magnitude over and above state-of-the-art proposals with a mean absolute error limited to 4% for a wide range of test cases. Furthermore, our method accurately captures the steady-state as well as the transient variation in temperature.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based approaches for pose estimation have been previously introduced. However, the quest for better performance still persists especially for accurate robotics manipulation. This quest extends to the Agri-robotics domain. In this paper, we propose TransPose, an improved Transformer-based 6D pose estimation with a depth refinement module. The architecture takes in only an RGB image as input with no additional supplementing modalities such as depth or thermal images. The architecture encompasses an innovative lighter depth estimation network that estimates depth from an RGB image using feature pyramid with an up-sampling method. A transformer-based detection network with additional prediction heads is proposed to directly regress the object's centre and predict the 6D pose of the target. A novel depth refinement module is then used alongside the predicted centers, 6D poses and depth patches to refine the accuracy of the estimated 6D pose. We extensively compared our results with other state-of-the-art methods and analysed our results for fruit-picking applications. The results we achieved show that our proposed technique outperforms the other methods available in the literature.

Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in challenging these conditions. However, most deep learning-based object trackers only use visible band (RGB) images. Thermal infrared electromagnetic waves (TIR) can provide additional information about an object, including its temperature, when faced with challenging conditions. We propose a deep learning-based image tracking approach that fuses RGB and thermal images (RGBT). The proposed model consists of two main components: a feature extractor and a tracker. The feature extractor encodes deep features from both the RGB and the TIR images. The tracker then uses these features to track the object using an enhanced attribute-based architecture. We propose a fusion of attribute-specific feature selection with an aggregation module. The proposed methods are evaluated on the RGBT234 \cite{LiCLiang2018} and LasHeR \cite{LiLasher2021} datasets, which are the most widely used RGBT object-tracking datasets in the literature. The results show that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art RGBT object trackers on these datasets, with a relatively smaller number of parameters.

Model predictive control (MPC) demonstrates great potential in improving the performance of heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, whereas its wide application in the building sector is impeded by the considerable manual efforts involved in setting up the control-oriented model. To facilitate the system identification (SI) of the building envelope as well as the configuration of the MPC algorithms with less human intervention, a semantic-assisted control framework is proposed in this paper. We first integrate different data sources required by the MPC algorithms such as the building topology, HVAC systems, sensor data stream and control settings in the form of a knowledge graph and then employ the data to set up the MPC algorithm automatically. Moreover, an event-triggered SI scheme is designed, to ensure the computational efficiency and accuracy of the MPC algorithm simultaneously. The proposed method is validated via simulations. The results demonstrate the practical relevance and effectiveness of the proposed semantics-assisted MPC framework with event-triggered learning of system dynamics.

We refer to this coupling scheme as the inexact Picard iteration method. Fourier analysis is performed to investigate how the convergence behavior of Picard iteration is influenced by the inexact neutronics solution. It is found that if the convergence of the inner neutronics iteration is slow, Picard coupling may become unstable unless a tighter tolerance is used for the neutronics iteration. Nevertheless, our analysis indicates that a certain amount of over-solving is necessary for maintaining the stability of Picard iteration if the iterative solution of the subproblem is not fast enough. However, this issue has not been addressed in the previous studies.

Quick estimation of machine's dimensions is important in the sales tool to provide quick quotations to customers based on specific requirements.

Object detections on the images are obtained using a neural network for each type of camera. The cameras are modelled as direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensors. Each DOA detection follows a von-Mises Fisher distribution, whose mean direction is obtain by projecting a vehicle position on the ground to the camera. We then use the trajectory Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture filter (TPMBM), which is a Bayesian MOT algorithm, to optimally estimate the set of vehicle trajectories. We have also developed a parameter estimation algorithm for the measurement model. We have tested the accuracy of the resulting TPMBM filter in synthetic and experimental data sets.

To explore the mechanism leading to the ITR, in this work, the dynamic behaviors of phonons passing through the GaN/AlN interface with an amorphous interlayer is investigated by using phonon wave packet simulation. It is found the amorphous interlayer significantly impedes phonon transport across the interface, and leads to remarkable phonon mode conversions, such as LA$\rightarrow$TA, TA$\rightarrow$LA, and LA$\rightarrow$TO conversion. However, due to mode conversion and inelastic scattering, we found a portion of high-frequency TA phonons, which are higher than the cut-off frequency and cannot transmit across the ideal sharp interface, can partially transmit across the amorphous interlayer, which introduces additional thermal transport channels through the interface and has positive effect on interfacial thermal conductance. According to phonon transmission coefficient, it is found the ITR increases with increasing of amorphous interlayer thickness L. The phonon transmission coefficient exhibits an obvious oscillation behavior, which is attributed to the multiple phonon scattering in the amorphous interlayer, and the oscillation period is further revealed to be consistent with the theoretical prediction by the two-beam interference equation. In addition, obvious phonon frequency shifts and phonon energy localization phenomena were observed in the amorphous interlayer. Finally, to improve phonon transmission, the interface morphology was further optimized via the annealing reconstruction technique, which results in re-crystallization of the amorphous interlayer and the decrease of ITR by ~21% as L=2 nm.

Further, we obtain hardness of approximation results for approximating probability amplitudes of quantum circuits and partition functions of quantum spin systems. This establishes a computational complexity transition for these problems and shows that our algorithmic conditions are optimal under complexity-theoretic assumptions. Finally, we show that our algorithmic condition is almost optimal for expectation values and optimal for thermal expectation values in the sense of zero freeness.

Special 2D structure of graphene enables it to exhibit a wide range of peculiar material properties like high Young's modulus, high specific strength etc. which are critical for myriad of applications including light weight structural materials, multi-functional coating and flexible electronics. It is quite challenging and costly to experimentally investigate graphene/graphene based nanocomposites, computational simulations such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely adopted for understanding the microscopic origins of their unique properties. However, disparate results were reported from computational studies, especially MD simulations using various empirical inter-atomic potentials. In this work, an artificial neural network based interatomic potential has been developed for graphene to represent the potential energy surface based on first principle calculations. The developed machine learning potential (MLP) facilitates high fidelity MD simulations to approach the accuracy of ab initio methods but with a fraction of computational cost, which allows larger simulation size/length, and thereby enables accelerated discovery/design of graphene-based novel materials. Lattice parameter, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Young's modulus and yield strength are estimated using machine learning accelerated MD simulations (MLMD), which are compared to experimental/first principle calculations from previous literatures. It is demonstrated that MLMD can capture the dominating mechanism governing CTE of graphene, including effects from lattice parameter and out of plane rippling.

The method relies on a penalty factor (which is inversely related to body's permeability $Îº$) that must be large to enforce rigid body velocity in the solid domain. When the penalty factor is large, the discrete system of equations becomes stiff and difficult to solve numerically. In this paper, we propose a projection method-based preconditioning strategy for solving volume penalized (VP) incompressible and low-Mach Navier-Stokes equations. The projection preconditioner enables the monolithic solution of the coupled velocity-pressure system in both single phase and multiphase flow settings. In this approach, the penalty force is treated implicitly, which is allowed to take arbitrary large values without affecting the solver's convergence rate or causing numerical stiffness/instability. It is made possible by including the penalty term in the pressure Poisson equation. Solver scalability under grid refinement is demonstrated. A manufactured solution in a single phase setting is used to determine the spatial accuracy of the penalized solution. Second-order pointwise accuracy is achieved for both velocity and pressure solutions. Two multiphase fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems from the ocean engineering literature are also simulated to evaluate the solver's robustness and performance. The proposed solver allows us to investigate the effect of $Îº$ on the motion of the contact line over the surface of the immersed body. It also allows us to investigate the dynamics of the free surface of a solidifying metal

As a result, physics-based models of the ionosphere and thermosphere have emerged as a necessary tool for the prediction of atmospheric outputs under highly variable space weather conditions.
  This paper proposes a high-fidelity approach for physics-based space weather modeling based on the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations using a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method, combined with a matrix-free strategy suitable for high-performance computing on GPU architectures. The approach consists of a thermospheric model that describes a chemically frozen neutral atmosphere in non-hydrostatic equilibrium driven by the external excitation of the Sun. A novel set of variables is considered to treat the low densities present in the upper atmosphere and to accommodate the wide range of scales present in the problem. At the same time, and unlike most existing approaches, radial and angular directions are treated in a non-segregated approach.
  The study presents a set of numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy of the approximation and validate the current approach against observational data along a satellite orbit, including estimates of established empirical and physics-based models of the ionosphere-thermosphere system. Finally, a 1D radial derivation of the physics-based model is presented and utilized for conducting a parametric study of the main thermal quantities under various solar conditions.

These channels model non-orthogonal communications scenarios, such as the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scenario and underlay cognitive communications, in which the interference from other communications signals is much stronger than the thermal noise. Interference-limited communications is expected to become a very common scenario in future wireless communications systems, such as 5G, WiFi6, and beyond. As communications signals are inherently cyclostationary in continuous time (CT), then after sampling at the receiver, the discrete-time (DT) received signal model contains the sampled desired information signal with additive sampled CT cyclostationary noise. The sampled noise can be modeled as either a DT cyclostationary process or a DT almost-cyclostationary process, where in the latter case the resulting channel is not information-stable. In a previous work we characterized the capacity of this model for the case in which the DT noise is memoryless. In the current work we come closer to practical scenarios by modelling the resulting DT noise as a finite-memory random process. The presence of memory requires the development of a new set of tools for analyzing the capacity of channels with additive non-stationary noise which has memory. Our results show, for the first time, the relationship between memory, sampling frequency synchronization and capacity, for interference-limited communications. The insights from our work provide a link between the analog and the digital time domains, which has been missing in most previous works on capacity analysis. Thus, our results can help improving spectral efficiency and suggest optimal transceiver designs for future communications paradigms.

A prompt and accurate assessment of burns is essential for deciding definitive clinical treatments. Currently, the primary approach for burn assessments, via visual and tactile observations, is approximately 60%-80% accurate. The gold standard is biopsy and a close second would be non-invasive methods like Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) assessments, which have up to 97% accuracy in predicting burn severity and the required healing time. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning pipeline for assessing burn severities and segmenting the regions of skin that are affected by burn. Segmenting 2D colour images of burns allows for the injured versus non-injured skin to be delineated, clearly marking the extent and boundaries of the localized burn/region-of-interest, even during remote monitoring of a burn patient. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify four severities of burns. We built a saliency mapping method, Boundary Attention Mapping (BAM), that utilises this trained CNN for the purpose of accurately localizing and segmenting the burn regions from skin burn images. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline through extensive experiments and evaluations using two datasets; 1) A larger skin burn image dataset consisting of 1684 skin burn images of four burn severities, 2) An LDI dataset that consists of a total of 184 skin burn images with their associated LDI scans. The CNN trained using the first dataset achieved an average F1-Score of 78% and micro/macro- average ROC of 85% in classifying the four burn severities. Moreover, a comparison between the BAM results and LDI results for measuring injury boundary showed that the segmentations generated by our method achieved 91.60% accuracy, 78.17% sensitivity, and 93.37% specificity.

To address these issues, we propose algorithms and methods that can effectively distinguish between thermal and multiplicative noise and improve the precision of parameter estimation for optimal data analysis. Specifically, we explore the impact of both multiplicative and thermal noise on the obfuscation of the actual signal and propose methods to resolve them. First, we present an algorithm that can effectively separate thermal noise with comparable performance to Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) but with significantly improved speed. We then analyze multiplicative noise and demonstrate that HMC is insufficient for isolating thermal and multiplicative noise. However, we show that, with additional knowledge of the ratio between thermal and multiplicative noise, we can accurately distinguish between the two types of noise when provided with a sufficiently large sampling rate or an amplitude of multiplicative noise smaller than thermal noise. Thus, we demonstrate the mechanism underlying an otherwise counterintuitive phenomenon: when multiplicative noise dominates the noise spectrum, one can successfully estimate the parameters for such systems after adding additional white noise to shift the noise balance.

However, most existing methods cannot effectively utilize information from two modalities while optimizing time efficiency. These methods often prioritize accuracy or time efficiency, leaving room for improvement in their performance. To this end, we propose a new method bright channel prior attention for enhancing pedestrian detection in low-light conditions by integrating image enhancement and detection within a unified framework. The method uses the V-channel of the HSV image of the thermal image as an attention map to trigger the unsupervised auto-encoder for visible light images, which gradually emphasizes pedestrian features across layers. Moreover, we utilize unsupervised bright channel prior algorithms to address light compensation in low light images. The proposed method includes a self-attention enhancement module and a detection module, which work together to improve object detection. An initial illumination map is estimated using the BCP, guiding the learning of the self-attention map from the enhancement network to obtain more informative representation focused on pedestrians.

If HEMS knows occupancy status, consumers can gain more economic benefits and thermal comfort. However, for the building occupancy status, direct sensing is costly, inaccurate, and intrusive for residents. So, forecasting algorithms could serve as an effective alternative. The goal of this study is to present a non-intrusive, accurate, and cost-effective approach, to develop a multi-objective simulation model for the application of DRPs in a smart residential house, where (a) electrical load demand reduction, (b) adjustment in thermal comfort (AC) temperature setpoints, and (c) , worst cases scenario approach is very conservative. Because that is unlikely all uncertain parameters take their worst values at all times. So, the flexible robust counterpart optimization along with uncertainty budgets is developed to consider uncertainty realistically. Simulated results indicate that considering uncertainty increases the costs by 36 percent and decreases the AC temperature setpoints. Besides, using DRPs reduces demand by shifting some appliance operations to off-peak hours and lowers costs by 13.2 percent.

This study delves into the transient characteristics of SOCs and their dependence on dynamic heat and mass transfer processes. Non-dimensional analysis was used to identify influential parameters, followed by a 3-D numerical simulation-based parametric analysis to examine the dynamic gaseous and thermal responses of SOCs with varying dimensions, material properties, and operating conditions. For the first time, we proposed characteristic times to describe the relationship between SOC transients and multiple parameters. These characteristic times represent the overall heat and mass transfer rats in SOCs. Their effectiveness was validated against literature and demonstrated potential in characterizing the transient characteristics of other electrochemical cells. Besides, two examples are provided to illustrate how the characteristic times facilitate SOC design and control at minimal computational cost.

This paper studies a novel problem motivated by an example of district heating and cooling networks in Japan, where high-temperature steam is used as the heating medium. In steam-based networks, storage tanks are usually absent, and there is a strong need to utilize thermal inertia of the pipeline network as storage. However, this type of use of a heating network directly affects the operating condition of the network, and assuring safety and supply quality at the use side is an open problem. To address this, we formulate a novel control problem to utilize CHP units in frequency regulation market while satisfying physical constraints on a steam network described by a nonlinear model capturing dynamics of heat flows and heat accumulation in the network. Furthermore, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is proposed to solve this problem. By consistently combining several nonlinear control techniques, a computationally efficient MPC controller is obtained and shown to work in real-time.

Terramechanic characteristics can be inferred from the thermal behaviour of soils under the influence of sunlight using remote sensors such as Long-Wave Infrared cameras. However, this behaviour is greatly affected by the low atmospheric pressures of planets such as Mars, so practical models are needed to relate robot remote sensing data on Earth to target planetary exploration conditions. This article proposes a general framework based on multipurpose environmental chambers to generate representative diurnal cycle dataset pairs that can be useful to relate the thermal behaviour of a soil on Earth to the corresponding behaviour under planetary pressure conditions using remote sensing. Furthermore, we present an application of the proposed framework to generate datasets using the UMA-Laserlab chamber, which can replicate the atmospheric \ch{CO2} composition of Mars. In particular, we analyze the thermal behaviour of four soil samples of different granularity by comparing replicated Martian surface conditions and their Earth's diurnal cycle equivalent. Results indicate a correlation between granularity and thermal inertia that is consistent with available Mars surface measurements recorded by rovers. The resulting dataset pairs, consisting of representative diurnal cycle thermal images with heater, air, and subsurface temperatures, have been made available for the scientific community.

Adjusting zonal temperature set-points is one of the most promising measures to unlock the energy flexibility potential of central air conditioning systems in complex commercial buildings. However, most existing studies focused on quantifying the energy flexibility on the building level since only building-level energy consumption is normally metered in commercial buildings. This study aims to investigate the impacts of temperature set-point adjustment strategies on zone-level thermal and energy performance by developing a non-intrusive data-driven load disaggregation method (i.e., a virtual zonal power meter). Three university buildings in Northern California were selected to test the proposed load disaggregation method. We found that heterogeneities of energy use and energy flexibility existed across not only buildings but also air handling units (AHUs) and zones. Moreover, a small number of zones accounted for a large amount of energy use and energy flexibility; and the most energy-intensive zones are not necessarily the most energy-flexible zones. For the three tested buildings, the top 30% most energy-intensive zones accounted for around 60% of the total energy use; and the top 30% most energy-flexible zones provided around 80% of the total energy flexibility. The proposed method enables the electric grid or district energy system operators to regard the controlled energy-flexible entities as a fleet of AHUs or zones instead of a fleet of buildings and helps unlock the possibility for targeted demand flexibility strategies that balance zone-by-zone energy reduction with zone-by-zone costs to occupants.

We develop the model as an extension of a previously presented one, and then we test its accuracy by sweeping the main parameters of a 4-PAM-based communication system such as RIN coefficient, extinction ratio, CD coefficient and equalizer memory. Our findings show a remarkable agreement between time-domain simulations and analytical results, with SNR discrepancies below 0.1 dB in most cases, for both feed-forward and decision-feedback equalization. We consider that the proposed model is a powerful tool for the numerical design of strongly band-limited IMDD systems using receiver equalization, as it happens in most of modern and future M-PAM solutions for short reach and access systems.

The electrification of the residential heat sector is an option to decarbonise the heat sector in the United Kingdom. The inherent flexibility that is available in the residential heat sector, in the form of the thermal inertia of buildings, is expected to play an important role in supporting the critical task of short-term balancing of electricity supply and demand. This paper proposes a method for characterising the locally aggregated flexibility envelope from the electrified residential heat sector, considering the most influential factors including outdoor and indoor temperature, thermal mass and heat loss of dwellings. Applying the method to England and Wales as a case study, demonstrated a significant potential for a temporary reduction of electricity demand for heating even during cold weather. Total electricity demand reductions of approximately 25 GW to 85 GW were shown to be achievable for the outdoor temperature of 10 degreeC and -5 degreeC, respectively. Improving the energy performance of the housing stock in England and Wales was shown to reduce the magnitude of available flexibility to approximately 18 GW to 60 GW for the outdoor temperature of 10 degreeC and -5 degreeC, respectively. This is due to the use of smaller size heat pumps in the more efficient housing stock. However, the impact of the buildings' retrofit on their thermal mass and consequently on the duration of the flexibility provision is uncertain.

However, real-world tasks include low-lighting conditions which arise performance bottlenecks for models trained on large-scale RGB image datasets. Thermal IR cameras are more robust against such conditions. Therefore, the usage of thermal imagery in real-world applications can be useful. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) allows transferring information from a source domain to a fully unlabeled target domain. Despite substantial improvements in UDA, the performance gap between UDA and its supervised learning counterpart remains significant. By picking a small number of target samples to annotate and using them in training, active domain adaptation tries to mitigate this gap with minimum annotation expense. We propose an active domain adaptation method in order to examine the efficiency of combining the visible spectrum and thermal imagery modalities. When the domain gap is considerably large as in the visible-to-thermal task, we may conclude that the methods without explicit domain alignment cannot achieve their full potential. To this end, we propose a spectral transfer guided active domain adaptation method to select the most informative unlabeled target samples while aligning source and target domains. We used the large-scale visible spectrum dataset MS-COCO as the source domain and the thermal dataset FLIR ADAS as the target domain to present the results of our method. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art active domain adaptation methods. The code and models are publicly available.

The mitigation of transient faults and permanent faults at the core level has become an important design parameter in a multi-core scenario. Core level techniques is a redundancy-based fault mitigation technique that improves the lifetime reliability of multi-core systems. In an asymmetric multi-core system, the smaller cores provide fault tolerance to larger cores is a core level fault mitigation technique that has gained momentum and focus from many researchers. The paper presents an economical, asymmetric multi-core system with one instruction cores (MCSOIC). The term Hardware Cost Estimation signifies power and area estimation for MCS-OIC. In MCSOIC, OIC is a warm standby redundant core. OICs provide functional support to conventional cores for shorter periods of time. To evaluate the idea, different configurations of MCSOIC is synthesized using FPGA and ASIC. The maximum power overhead and maximum area overhead are 0.46% and 11.4% respectively. The behavior of OICs in MCS-OIC is modelled using a One-Shot System (OSS) model for reliability analysis. The model parameters namely, readiness, wakeup probability and start-up-strategy for OSS are mapped to the multi-core systems with OICs. Expressions for system reliability is derived. System reliability is estimated for special cases.

Therefore, the automatic detection of whether there is a mask on the face, what type of mask is worn, and how it is worn is an important research topic. In this work, the use of thermal imaging was considered to analyze the possibility of detecting (localizing) a mask on the face, as well as to check whether it is possible to classify the type of mask on the face. The previously proposed dataset of thermal images was extended and annotated with the description of a type of mask and a location of a mask within a face. Different deep learning models were adapted. The best model for face mask detection turned out to be the Yolov5 model in the "nano" version, reaching mAP higher than 97% and precision of about 95%. High accuracy was also obtained for mask type classification. The best results were obtained for the convolutional neural network model built on an autoencoder initially trained in the thermal image reconstruction problem. The pretrained encoder was used to train a classifier which achieved an accuracy of 91%.

This study investigates a two-scale data-driven design for thermal metamaterials with various functionalities. To address the complexity of multiscale design, the design variables are chosen as the components of the homogenized thermal conductivity matrix originating from the lower scale unit cells. Multiple macroscopic functionalities including thermal cloak, thermal concentrator, thermal rotator/inverter, and their combinations, are achieved using the developed approach. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the effect of each design variable on the desired functionalities, which is then incorporated into topology optimization. Geometric extraction demonstrates an excellent matching between the optimized homogenized conductivity and the extraction from the constructed database containing both architecture and property information. The designed heterostructures exhibit multiple thermal meta-functionalities that can be applied to a wide range of heat transfer fields from personal computers to aerospace engineering.

To construct a digital twin of a thermal system, it is required to make online estimations of unknown time-varying boundary conditions from sensor measured data, which needs to solve inverse heat transfer problems (IHTPs). However, a fast and accurate solution is challenging since the measured data is normally contaminated with noise and the traditional method to solve IHTP involves significant amount of calculations. Therefore, in this work, a rapid yet robust inversion algorithm called ANN-based extended Kalman smoothing algorithm is developed to realize the online prediction of desired parameter based on the measurements. The fast prediction is realized by replacing the conventional CFD-based state transfer models in extended Kalman smoothing algorithm with pre-trained ANN. Then, a two-dimensional internal convective heat transfer problem was employed as the case study to test the algorithm. The results have proved that the proposed algorithm is a computational-light and robust approach for solving IHTPs. The proposed algorithm can achieve estimation of unknown boundary conditions with a dimensionless average error of 0.0580 under noisy temperature measurement with a standard deviation of 10 K with a drastic reduction of computational cost compared to the conventional approach. Moreover, the effects of training data, location of sensor, future time step selection on the performance of prediction are investigated.

While performing a role similar to a battery in an electrical system, it is critical to know when to charge (freeze) and discharge (melt) the TES to maximize the capabilities and efficiency of the overall system. Therefore, control-oriented models of TES are needed to predict the behavior of the TES and make informed control decisions. While existing modeling approaches divide the TES in to multiple sections using a Fixed Grid (FG) approach, this paper proposes a switched Moving Boundary (MB) model that captures the key dynamics of the TES with significantly fewer dynamic states. Specifically, a graph-based modeling approach is used to model the heat flow through the TES and a MB approach is used to model the time-varying liquid and solid regions of the TES. Additionally, a Finite State Machine (FSM) is used to switch between four different modes of operation based on the State-of-Charge (SOC) of the TES. Numerical simulations comparing the proposed approach with a more traditional FG approach show that the MB model is capable of accurately modeling the behavior of the FG model while using far fewer states, leading to five times faster simulations.

Despite this benefit, widespread use of AHPDs is still limited. One reason for this is partly unsatisfactory control performance under varying operating conditions, which can result in poor modulation and part load capability. A promising approach to tackle this issue is using dynamic, model-based control strategies, whose effectiveness, however, strongly depend on the model being used. This paper therefore focuses on the derivation of a viable dynamic model to be used for such model-based control strategies for AHPDs such as state feedback or model-predictive control. The derived model is experimentally validated, showing good modeling accuracy. Its modeling accuracy is also compared to alternative model versions, that contain other heat transfer correlations, as a benchmark. Although the derived model is mathematically simple, it does have the structure of a nonlinear differential-algebraic system of equations. To obtain an even simpler model structure, linearization at an operating point is discussed to derive a model in linear state space representation. The experimental validation shows that the linear model does have slightly worse steady-state accuracy, but that the dynamic accuracy seems to be almost unaffected by the linearization. The presented new modeling approach is considered suitable to be used as a basis for the design of advanced, model-based control strategies, ultimately aiming to improve the modulation and part load capability of AHPDs.

However, current few physical infrared attacks are complicated to implement in practical application because of their complex transformation from digital world to physical world. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a physically feasible infrared attack method called "adversarial infrared patches". Considering the imaging mechanism of infrared cameras by capturing objects' thermal radiation, adversarial infrared patches conduct attacks by attaching a patch of thermal insulation materials on the target object to manipulate its thermal distribution. To enhance adversarial attacks, we present a novel aggregation regularization to guide the simultaneous learning for the patch' shape and location on the target object. Thus, a simple gradient-based optimization can be adapted to solve for them. We verify adversarial infrared patches in different object detection tasks with various object detectors. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than 90\% Attack Success Rate (ASR) versus the pedestrian detector and vehicle detector in the physical environment, where the objects are captured in different angles, distances, postures, and scenes. More importantly, adversarial infrared patch is easy to implement, and it only needs 0.5 hours to be constructed in the physical world, which verifies its effectiveness and efficiency.

The Landau damping phenomenon consists of the damping of small oscillations in plasmas without collisions. In the PIC method, a hybrid discretization is constructed with a grid of finitely supported basis functions to represent the electric, magnetic and/or gravitational fields, and a distribution of delta functions to represent the particle field. Approximations to the dispersion relation are found to be inadequate in accurately calculating values for the electric field frequency and damping rate when parameters of the physical system, such as the plasma frequency or thermal velocity, are varied. We present a full derivation and numerical solution for the dispersion relation, and verify the PETSC-PIC numerical solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson for a large range of wave numbers and charge densities.

The need to properly resolve spatial and temporal scales spanning multiple orders of magnitude pushes the limits of both our theoretical models as well as our computational capabilities. Rigorous upscaling techniques enable efficient computation while bounding/tracking errors and helping to make informed cost-accuracy tradeoffs. The biggest challenges arise when the applicability conditions of upscaled models break down. Here, we present a non-intrusive two-way (iterative bottom-up top-down) coupled hybrid model, applied to thermal runaway in battery packs, that combines fine-scale and upscaled equations in the same numerical simulation to achieve predictive accuracy while limiting computational costs. First, we develop two methods with different orders of accuracy to enforce continuity at the coupling boundary. Then, we derive weak (i.e., variational) formulations of the fine-scale and upscaled governing equations for finite element (FE) discretization and numerical implementation in FEniCS. We demonstrate that hybrid simulations can accurately predict the average temperature fields within error bounds determined a priori by homogenization theory. Finally, we demonstrate the computational efficiency of the hybrid algorithm against fine-scale simulations.

Surprisingly, it is also possible to image hidden voids and inclusions buried within an object using a single static thermal or mechanical loading experiment by observing the response of the exposed surface of the body, but this problem is challenging to invert. Although physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise as a simple-yet-powerful tool for problem inversion, they have not yet been applied to imaging problems with a priori unknown topology. Here, we introduce a topology optimization framework based on PINNs that identifies concealed geometries using exposed surface data from a single loading experiment, without prior knowledge of the number or types of shapes. We allow for arbitrary solution topology by representing the geometry using a material density field combined with a novel eikonal regularization technique. We validate our framework by detecting the number, locations, and shapes of hidden voids and inclusions in many example cases, in both 2D and 3D, and we demonstrate the method's robustness to noise and sparsity in the data. Our methodology opens a pathway for PINNs to solve geometry optimization problems in engineering.

Parts with graded lattice elements can provide interesting mechanical, thermal, and acoustic properties compared to parts where only coarse features are included. One of these improvements is better global buckling resistance of the component. However, thin features are prone to local buckling. Normally, analyses with high computational effort are conducted on high-resolution finite element meshes to optimize parts with good global and local stability. Until recently, works focused only on either global or local buckling behavior. We use two-scale optimization based on asymptotic homogenization of elastic properties and local buckling behavior to reduce the effort of full-scale analyses. For this, we present an approach for concurrent local and global buckling optimization of parameterized graded lattice structures. It is based on a worst-case model for the homogenized buckling load factor, which acts as a safeguard against pure local buckling. Cross-modes residing on both scales are not detected. We support our theory with numerical examples and validations on dehomogenized designs, which show the capabilities of our method, and discuss the advantages and limitations of the worst-case model.

However, current approaches that automatically setback thermostats on the hottest day compromise their efficacy by neglecting human-building interaction (HBI). This study aims to define challenges and opportunities for developing engineering models of HBI to be used in the design of controls for grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs). Building system and measured and just-in-time surveyed psychophysiological data were collected from 41 participants in 20 homes from April-September. ASHRAE Standard 55 thermal comfort models for building design were evaluated with these data. Increased error bias was observed with increasing spatiotemporal temperature variations. Unsurprising, considering these models neglect such variance, but questioning their suitability for GEBs controlling thermostat setpoints, and given the observed 4Â°F intra-home spatial temperature variation. The results highlight opportunities for reducing these biases in GEBs through a paradigm shift to modeling discomfort instead of comfort, increasing use of low-cost sensors, and models that account for the observed dynamic occupant behavior: of the thermostat setpoint overrides made with 140-minutes of a previous setpoint change, 95% of small changes ( 2Â°F) were made with 120-minutes, while 95% of larger changes ( 10Â°F) were made within only 70-minutes.

Ventilated disc brake with an outer diameter of 175 mm has been used for the system level analysis and 83 % performance efficiency has been achieved after all the proper validations and analysis. Stainless Steel (SS-410) material configuration has been considered for the disc brake and performance enhancement of ventilated disc brake has been carried out using Matlab, Ansys, and Solidworks. The brake disc is going to be deployed as a common brake disc in the rear part of the All-terrain vehicle, and is responsible for providing effective rear wheel locking, and piaggio double piston fixed calipers have satisfied the piston diameter for the wheel locking conditions at rear wheels with DOT-4 Brake fluid in the master cylinder in order to provide the effective braking. The rear disc brake is fixed on the gearbox output shaft and a caliper mount is welded on a rear member of the roll cage. A mathematical model has been formulated for carrying out Multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization, which has resulted, a newly designed brake disc is optimum in terms of weight, factor of safety, thermal dissipation, equivalent stress, vibration with enhanced airflow behavior. Converged residual plots have been obtained in computational fluid dynamics simulation by using 2nd-degree order to validate the CFD models, and in order to meet the frequency of rear disc brake to firing frequency of engine, design constraints of the brake disc have been optimized in terms of vibration along with considering the other parameters.

We derive second-order asymptotic expressions for the optimal transformation rate $R_n$ in the small, moderate, and large deviation error regimes, as well as the zero-error regime, for an arbitrary pair $(Ï_1,Ï_1)$ of initial states and a commuting pair $(Ï_2,Ï_2)$ of final states. We also prove that for $Ï_1$ and $Ï_2$ given by thermal Gibbs states, the derived optimal transformation rates in the first three regimes can be attained by thermal operations. This allows us, for the first time, to study the second-order asymptotics of thermodynamic state interconversion with fully general initial states that may have coherence between different energy eigenspaces. Thus, we discuss the optimal performance of thermodynamic protocols with coherent inputs and describe three novel resonance phenomena allowing one to significantly reduce transformation errors induced by finite-size effects. What is more, our result on quantum dichotomies can also be used to obtain, up to second-order asymptotic terms, optimal conversion rates between pure bipartite entangled states under local operations and classical communication.

To bridge size and time-scale while limiting computational effort, typically the concept of representative volume elements (RVEs) is employed. This approach considers the microstructure evolution in a volume that is representative of the overall material behavior. However, in settings with complex thermal and mechanical loading histories careful consideration of the impact of modeling constraints in terms of time scale and simulation domain on predicted results is required. We address the representation of heterogeneous dislocation structure formation in simulation volumes using the example of residual stress formation during cool-down of laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) of AISI 316L stainless steel. This is achieved by a series of large-scale three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations assisted by thermo-mechanical finite element modeling of the LPBF process. Our results show that insufficient size of periodic simulation domains can result in dislocation patterns that reflect the boundaries of the primary cell. More pronounced dislocation interaction observed for larger domains highlight the significance of simulation domain constraints for predicting mechanical properties. We formulate criteria that characterize representative volume elements by capturing the conformity of the dislocation structure to the bulk material. This work provides a basis for future investigations of heterogeneous microstructure formation in mesoscale simulations of bulk material behavior.

Firstly, according to the characteristics of load response, the demand response is divided into four types: which can be shifted, transferred, reduced and replaced. Secondly, the PIES basic architecture is given by considering the combined heat and power generation coupling equipment, new energy and flexible load in the park. Finally, introducing the ladder-type carbon trading mechanism into the system and minimize the total operating cost, the low-carbon economic operation optimization model of PIES is established. The YALMIP toolbox and CPLEX solver are used to solve the example, the simulation results show that the participation of electrical and thermal coupled scheduling and flexible electric or thermal loads can significantly reduce the system operating cost, reduce the load peak-to-valley difference and relieve peak power consumption pressure.

This work introduces the reliable data set for training the AI subsystem for thermal comfort. This paper presents the control algorithm based on shallow supervised learning, which is simple enough to be implemented in the Internet of Things (IoT) system for residential usage using ASHRAE RP-884 and ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II. No training data for thermal comfort is available as reliable as this dataset, but the direct use of this data can lead to overfitting. This work offers the algorithm for data filtering and semantic data augmentation for the ASHRAE database for the supervised learning process. Overfitting always becomes a problem due to the psychological aspect involved in the thermal comfort decision. The method to check the AI system based on the psychrometric chart against overfitting is presented. This paper also assesses the most important parameters needed to achieve human thermal comfort. This method can support the development of reinforced learning for thermal comfort.

Amongst these, the flexible Programmable-bevel tip needle (PBN) concept has successfully achieved an in-vivo demonstration to evaluate the feasibility of Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) of chemotherapeutics within the ovine model, with a 2.5 mm PBN prototype. However, further size reduction is necessary for other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures involving deep-seated tissue structures. Since PBNs have a complex cross-section geometry, standard production methods, such as extrusion, fails as the outer diameter is reduced further. This paper presents our first attempt to demonstrate a new manufacturing method for the PBN that employs thermal drawing technology. Experimental characterisation tests were performed for the 2.5 mm PBN and a new 1.3 mm Thermally Drawn (TD) PBN prototype described here. The results show that thermal drawing presents a significant advantage in miniaturising complex needle structures. However, the steering behaviour is affected due to the choice of material in this first attempt, a limitation which will be addressed in future work.

On-demand degradable soft robots, which conserve their original functionality during operation and rapidly degrade under specific external stimulation, present the opportunity to self-direct the disappearance of temporary robots. This study proposes soft robots and materials that exhibit excellent mechanical stretchability and can degrade under ultraviolet (UV) light by mixing a fluoride-generating diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate (DPI-HFP) with a silicone resin. Spectroscopic analysis revealed the mechanism of Si-O-Si backbone cleavage using fluoride ion (F-), which was generated from UV exposed DPI-HFP. Furthermore, photo-differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) based thermal analysis indicated increased decomposition kinetics at increased temperatures. Additionally, we demonstrated a robotics application of this composite by fabricating a gaiting robot. The integration of soft electronics, including strain sensors, temperature sensors, and photodetectors, expanded the robotic functionalities. This study provides a simple yet novel strategy for designing lifecycle mimicking soft robotics that can be applied to reduce soft robotics waste, explore hazardous areas where retrieval of robots is impossible, and ensure hardware security with on-demand destructive material platforms.

According to the common tumor CT scans, two different scenarios have been implemented to describe irregular shape of the malignant tumor. In the first scenario, tumor has been considered as a polygon base prism and in the second one, it has been considered as a star-shaped base prism. By increasing the number of sides of the polygon or wings of the star, degree of the malignancy has been increased. Constant heat generation has been considered for the tumor and finite element analysis has been conducted by the ABAQUS software linked with a PYTHON script on both tumor models to study temperature variations on the top tissue surface. This temperature distribution has been characterized by 10 parameters. In each scenario, 98 sets of these parameters has been used as inputs of a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and number of sides or wings has been selected to be the output. The RBFNN has been trained to identify malignancy of tumor based on its morphology.

Here we propose a multispectral pedestrian detection algorithm, which mainly consists of a cascaded information enhancement module and a cross-modal attention feature fusion module. On the one hand, the cascaded information enhancement module adopts the channel and spatial attention mechanism to perform attention weighting on the features fused by the cascaded feature fusion block. Moreover, it multiplies the single-modal features with the attention weight element by element to enhance the pedestrian features in the single-modal and thus suppress the interference from the background. On the other hand, the cross-modal attention feature fusion module mines the features of both Color and Thermal modalities to complement each other, then the global features are constructed by adding the cross-modal complemented features element by element, which are attentionally weighted to achieve the effective fusion of the two modal features. Finally, the fused features are input into the detection head to detect and locate pedestrians. Extensive experiments have been performed on two improved versions of annotations (sanitized annotations and paired annotations) of the public dataset KAIST. The experimental results show that our method demonstrates a lower pedestrian miss rate and more accurate pedestrian detection boxes compared to the comparison method. Additionally, the ablation experiment also proved the effectiveness of each module designed in this paper.

In particular, we parameterize the coarse-grained potential both with respect to the pair distance of the CG particles and the time, and we obtain an evolution model that is explicitly time-dependent. Moreover, we follow a data-driven approach to estimate the friction kernel, given by appropriate correlation functions directly from the underlying all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. To explore and validate the proposed methodology we study a benchmark system of a moving particle in a box. We examine the suggested model's effectiveness in terms of the system's correlation time and find that the model can approximate well the transient time regime of the system, depending on the correlation time of the system. As a result, in the less correlated case, it can represent the dynamics for a longer time interval. We present an extensive study of our approach to a realistic high-dimensional water molecular system. Posing the water system initially out of thermal equilibrium we collect trajectories of all-atom data for the, empirically estimated, transient time regime. Then, we infer the suggested model and strengthen the model's validity by comparing it with simplified Markovian models.

We show that the proposed graph learning approach is equivalent to solving the classical graphical Lasso problems with Laplacian-like precision matrices. We prove that given $O(\log N)$ pairs of voltage and current measurements, it is possible to recover sparse $N$-node resistor networks that can well preserve the effective resistance distances on the original graph. In addition, the learned graphs also preserve the structural (spectral) properties of the original graph, which can potentially be leveraged in many circuit design and optimization tasks.
  To achieve more scalable performance, we also introduce a solver-free method (SF-SGL) that exploits multilevel spectral approximation of the graphs and allows for a scalable and flexible decomposition of the entire graph spectrum (to be learned) into multiple different eigenvalue clusters (frequency bands). Such a solver-free approach allows us to more efficiently identify the most spectrally-critical edges for reducing various ranges of spectral embedding distortions. Through extensive experiments for a variety of real-world test cases, we show that the proposed approach is highly scalable for learning sparse resistor networks without sacrificing solution quality. We also introduce a data-driven EDA algorithm for vectorless power/thermal integrity verifications to allow estimating worst-case voltage/temperature (gradient) distributions across the entire chip by leveraging a few voltage/temperature measurements.

ICDs are one of the effective treatments available to significantly improve survival of patients with fatal arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) disorders. Using a lithium battery power source, this life-saving device sends electrical shocks or pulses to regulate the heartbeat. The service life and reliability of an ICD is primarily expressed by its battery's lifespan and performance. In this paper we investigate the terminal voltage, depth of discharge (DOD) and temperature dynamics of the implantable lithium battery with a combined cathode material, namely carbon-monofluoride and silver vanadium oxide (Li/CFx-SVO). Modeling the implantable batteries characteristics is a well-established topic in literature; however, to the best of the author's knowledge, the impact of the high-energy shocks (defibrillation) and low-energy device power supply (housekeeping) on the ICD's battery operation is relatively less-explored. Our analysis reveals that the battery terminal voltage is primarily affected by small but continuous housekeeping discharge current in the range of uA, rather than intermittent high defibrillation current demand in the range of several amps. The results can be used to improve the device design control and operation, thus extending the service life in patients and reducing the need for invasive replacement surgery.

Different from existing deep RGB-T trackers that use a large number of annotated RGB-T image pairs for training, our RGB-T tracker is trained using unlabeled RGB-T video pairs in a self-supervised manner. We propose a novel cross-input consistency-based self-supervised training strategy based on the idea that tracking can be performed using different inputs. Specifically, we construct two distinct inputs using unlabeled RGB-T video pairs. We then track objects using these two inputs to generate results, based on which we construct our cross-input consistency loss. Meanwhile, we propose a reweighting strategy to make our loss function robust to low-quality training samples. We build our tracker on a Siamese correlation filter network. To the best of our knowledge, our tracker is the first self-supervised RGB-T tracker. Extensive experiments on two public RGB-T tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed training strategy is effective. Remarkably, despite training only with a corpus of unlabeled RGB-T video pairs, our tracker outperforms seven supervised RGB-T trackers on the GTOT dataset.

In this paper, we analyze how electrification can support the integration of fluctuating renewables, like wind and PV, and mitigate the need for storage and thermal backup plants. Using a cost minimizing model for system planning, we find substantial benefits of electricity demand in heating, transport, and industry adapting to supply. In Germany, flexible demand halves the residual peak-load and the residual demand and reduces excess generation by 80%. Flexible operation of electrolyzers has the most significant impact accounting for 42% of the reduction in residual peak-load and 59% in residual demand. District heating networks and BEVs also provide substantial flexibility, while the contribution of space and process heating is negligible. The results are robust to restrictions on the expansion of the transmission grid.

Using the lock-in thermography principle, an illumination source modulates the surface of those systems periodically by a planar, sinusoidal wave form with a fixed frequency. The coating systems absorb the optical energy on its surface and convert it into thermal energy, resulting in the propagation of a spatially and temporally periodic thermal wave with the same frequency. These thermal waves, originating at the surface, are reflected and transmitted at each interface leading to infinitely many wave trains that need to be tracked in order to formulate the final surface temperature as a superposition of all these waves. The heat transfer inside the object depends on the layer thickness of each coating, but also on the thermal properties of each layer material. The goal is to have a mathematical and physical model which describes the phase angle data measured by an infrared camera. Having these data, the main objective of this paper is to determine the thickness of each coating layer. In practice, the thermal properties of the layers usually are unknown, which makes the process even more difficult. For that reason, this article presents a concept to determine the thermal properties in advance.

The images were obtained for baseline, positive, and negative valence according to the protocol of the Geneva Affective Picture Database. Absolute and percentage differences of average values of the data between the valences and the baseline were calculated for different regions of interest (forehead, periorbital eyes, cheeks, nose and upper lips). For negative valence, a decrease in temperature and blood perfusion was observed in the regions of interest, and the effect was greater on the left side than on the right side. In positive valence, the temperature and blood perfusion increased in some cases, showing a complex pattern. The temperature and perfusion of the nose was reduced for both valences, which is indicative of the arousal dimension. The blood perfusion images were found to be greater contrast; the percentage differences in the blood perfusion images are greater than those obtained in thermographic images. Moreover, the blood perfusion images, and vasomotor answer are consistent, therefore, they can be a better biomarker than thermographic analysis in identifying emotions.

As buildings consume one-third of global energy and almost half of this energy accounts for Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, HVAC are suitable for shifting their electricity consumption in time. To this end, intelligent control strategies are necessary as the conventional control of HVAC is not optimized for the actual demand of occupants and the current situation in the electricity grid. In this paper, we present the novel multi-zone controller Price Storage Control (PSC) that not only considers room-individual Occupants' Thermal Satisfaction (OTS), but also the available energy storage, and energy prices. The main feature of PSC is that it does not need a building model or forecasts of future demands to derive the control actions for multiple rooms in a building. For comparison, we use an ideal, error-free Model Predictive Control (MPC), a simplified variant without storage consideration (PC), and a conventional hysteresis-based two-point control. We evaluate the four controllers in a multi-zone environment for heating a building in winter and consider two different scenarios that differ in how much the permitted temperatures vary. In addition, we compare the impact of model parameters with high and low thermal capacitance. The results show that PSC strongly outperforms the conventional control approach in both scenarios and for both parameters. For high capacitance, it leads to 22 % costs reduction while the ideal MPC achieves cost reductions of more than 39 %. Considering that PSC does not need any building model or forecast, as opposed to MPC, the results support the suitability of our developed control strategy for controlling HVAC systems in future energy systems.

Two Independent meshes are adopted by the steady electrical analysis and the transient thermal simulation to avoid redundant overhead. In order to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of solving multiscale and sophisticated structures, a local time stepping (LTS) technique coupled with an interpolation method is incorporated into the co-simulation method. Several numerical examples from simple structures to complex multiscale PDN structures are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method by comparing with the COMSOL. Finally, two practical numerical examples are considered to confirm the performance of the proposed method for complex and multiscale structures.

However, a legitimate concern of land developers is associated with the buildings' state of conservation. For that reason, infrared thermography has been used as a powerful tool to characterize these buildings' state of conservation by detecting pathologies, such as cracks and humidity. Thermal cameras detect the radiation emitted by any material and translate it into temperature-color-coded images. Abnormal temperature changes may indicate the presence of pathologies, however, reading thermal images might not be quite simple. This research project aims to combine infrared thermography and machine learning (ML) to help stakeholders determine the viability of reusing existing buildings by identifying their pathologies and defects more efficiently and accurately. In this particular phase of this research project, we've used an image classification machine learning model of Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) to differentiate three levels of cracks in one particular building. The model's accuracy was compared between the MSX and thermal images acquired from two distinct thermal cameras and fused images (formed through multisource information) to test the influence of the input data and network on the detection results.

It constantly receives data from its counterpart's sensors, consults external sources, and obtains manual inputs from its stakeholders. The DT uses all this information to make various computations, such as analyses, predictions, and simulations, and then possibly sends the results back to the physical system. Domotics, or Smart Home Technologies, brings intelligence and comfort to a house by automating some of its functions. Although the research on both themes is vast, there are few implementations of Smart Homes based on Digital Twin technologies, and this work aims to prove that residences can also benefit from this concept. We implement two different use cases showing that a two-way connection between a home and its virtual counterpart can provide its owners with analyses and simulation-based automation. The first study case allows the user to visualize their home appliances' past and present state concerning their energy consumption. Based on heating simulations, the second determines the best time to turn on a heater to increase the home's thermal comfort and reduce energy usage.

We present an RC-equivalent conceptual model for PV modules, where wind effects are captured. We show how the thermal time constant $Ï$ of PV modules can be determined from measured data, and subsequently used to make static thermal models dynamic by applying the Exponential Weighted Mean (EWM) approach to irradiance and wind signals. On average, $Ï$ is $6.3 \pm 1~$min for fixed-mount PV systems. Based on this conceptual model, the Filter- EWM - Mean Bias Error correction (FEM) methodology is developed. We propose two thermal models, WM1 and WM2, and compare these against the models of Ross, Sandia, and Faiman on twenty-four datasets of fifteen sites, with time resolutions ranging from 1$~$s to 1$~$h, the majority of these at 1$~$min resolution. The FEM methodology is shown to reduce model errors (RMSE and MAE) on average for all sites and models versus the standard steady-state equivalent by -1.1$~$K and -0.75$~$K respectively.

In this paper, we construct a structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent finite element method and time-stepping scheme for heat conducting viscous fluids, with general state equations. The method is deduced by discretizing a variational formulation for nonequilibrium thermodynamics that extends Hamilton's principle for fluids to systems with irreversible processes. The resulting scheme preserves the balance of energy and mass to machine precision, as well as the second law of thermodynamics, both at the spatially and temporally discrete levels. The method is shown to apply both with insulated and prescribed heat flux boundary conditions, as well as with prescribed temperature boundary conditions. We illustrate the properties of the scheme with the Rayleigh-BÃ©nard thermal convection. While the focus is on heat conducting viscous fluids, the proposed discrete variational framework paves the way to a systematic construction of thermodynamically consistent discretizations of continuum systems.

Understanding the impact of AM process conditions on the microstructure evolution and the resulting mechanical properties of the printed part is an active area of research. At the meltpool scale, the thermo-fluidic governing equations have been extensively modeled in the literature to understand the meltpool conditions and the thermal gradients in its vicinity. In many phenomena governed by partial differential equations, dimensional analysis and identification of important dimensionless numbers can provide significant insights into the process dynamics. In this context, a novel strategy using dimensional analysis and the method of linear least squares regression to numerically investigate the thermo-fluidic governing equations of the Laser Powder Bed Fusion AM process is presented in this work. First, the governing equations are solved using the Finite Element Method, and the model predictions are validated by comparing with experimentally estimated cooling rates, and with numerical results from the literature. Then, through dimensional analysis, an important dimensionless quantity - interpreted as a measure of heat absorbed by the powdered material and the meltpool, is identified. This dimensionless measure of heat absorbed, along with classical dimensionless quantities such as Peclet, Marangoni, and Stefan numbers, is used to investigate advective transport in the meltpool for different alloys. Further, the framework is used to study the variations of thermal gradients and the solidification cooling rate. Important correlations linking meltpool morphology and microstructure evolution related variables with classical dimensionless numbers are the key contribution of this work.

This paper presents a data-driven approach for online anomaly detection in battery packs that uses real-time voltage and temperature data from multiple Li-ion battery cells. Mean-based residuals are generated for cell groups and evaluated using Principal Component Analysis. The evaluated residuals are then thresholded using a cumulative sum control chart to detect anomalies. The mild external short circuits associated with cell balancing are detected in the voltage signals and necessitate voltage retraining after balancing. Temperature residuals prove to be critical, enabling anomaly detection of module balancing events within 14 min that are unobservable from the voltage residuals. Statistical testing of the proposed approach is performed on the experimental data from a battery electric locomotive injected with model-based anomalies. The proposed anomaly detection approach has a low false-positive rate and accurately detects and traces the synthetic voltage and temperature anomalies. The performance of the proposed approach compared with direct thresholding of mean-based residuals shows a 56% faster detection time, 42% fewer false negatives, and 60% fewer missed anomalies while maintaining a comparable false-positive rate.

This broad adoption facilitates users' lives, but it also brings problems. One such issue is that some IoT devices may invade users' privacy. Some reasons for this invasion can stem from obscure data collection practices or hidden devices. Specific IoT devices can exist out of sight and still collect user data to send to third parties via the Internet. Owners can easily forget the location or even the existence of these devices, especially if the owner is a landlord who manages several properties. The landlord-owner scenario creates multi-user problems as designers build machines for single users. We developed tags that use wireless protocols, buzzers, and LED lighting to lead users to solve the issue of device discovery in shared spaces and accommodate multi-user scenarios. They are attached to IoT devices inside a unit during their installation to be later discovered by a tenant. These tags have similar functionalities as the popular Tile models or Airtag, but our tags have different features based on our privacy use case. Our tags do not require pairing; multiple users can interact with them through our Android application. Although researchers developed several other tools, such as thermal cameras or virtual reality (VR), for discovering devices in environments, they have not used wireless protocols as a solution. We measured specific performance metrics of our tags to analyze their feasibility for this problem. We also conducted a user study to measure the participants' comfort levels while finding objects with our tags attached. Our results indicate that wireless tags can be viable for device tracking in residential properties.

Accurate calibration of these datasets gives the correspondence needed by inter-instrument studies and learning-based magnetogram systems, and is required for physically-meaningful photospheric magnetic field vectors. We approach the problem by robustly fitting geometric models on correspondences between images from each instrument's pipeline. This technique is common in computer vision, but several critical details are required when using scanning slit spectrograph data like Hinode/SOT-SP. We apply this technique to data spanning a decade of the Hinode mission. Our results suggest corrections to the published Level 2 Hinode/SOT-SP data. First, an analysis on approximately 2,700 scans suggests that the reported pixel size in Hinode/SOT-SP Level 2 data is incorrect by around 1%. Second, analysis of over 12,000 scans show that the pointing information is often incorrect by dozens of arcseconds with a strong bias. Regression of these corrections indicates that thermal effects have caused secular and cyclic drift in Hinode/SOT-SP pointing data over its mission. We offer two solutions. First, direct co-alignment with SDO/HMI data via our procedure can improve alignments for many Hinode/SOT-SP scans. Second, since the pointing errors are predictable, simple post-hoc corrections can substantially improve the pointing. We conclude by illustrating the impact of this updated calibration on derived physical data products needed for research and interpretation. Among other things, our results suggest that the pointing errors induce a hemispheric bias in estimates of radial current density.

We use a format inspired by the hierarchical off-diagonal low rank format, where elements are recursively partitioned using a quadtree or octree and blocks are compressed using a sparse singular value decomposition -- the hierarchical matrix is assembled using dynamic programming. The motivating application is time-dependent thermal modeling on vast planetary surfaces, with a focus on permanently shadowed craters which receive energy through indirect irradiance. In this setting, shape models are comprised of a large number of triangular facets which conform to a rough surface. At each time step, a quadratic number of triangle-to-triangle scattered fluxes must be summed; that is, as the sun moves through the sky, we must solve the same view factor system of equations for a potentially unlimited number of time-varying righthand sides. We first conduct numerical experiments with a synthetic spherical cap-shaped crater, where the equilibrium temperature is analytically available. We also test our implementation with triangle meshes of planetary surfaces derived from digital elevation models recovered by orbiting spacecrafts. Our results indicate that the compressed view factor matrix can be assembled in quadratic time, which is comparable to the time it takes to assemble the full view matrix itself. Memory requirements during assembly are reduced by a large factor. Finally, for a range of compression tolerances, the size of the compressed view factor matrix and the speed of the resulting matrix vector product both scale linearly (as opposed to quadratically for the full matrix), resulting in orders of magnitude savings in processing time and memory space.

These are gradually replacing conventional thermal power plants which today are the main providers of black start (BS) services. Consequently, in case of a total/partial blackout, conventional black-start resources are not ready for operation. Offshore wind farms (OWFs), with their large capacity and fast controllers, have potential as novel BS units. This new service introduces a need for a new design for wind power systems to be able to fulfil the black start requirements for non-traditional generation units. In this paper, challenges, and possible solutions in integrating BS services into OWFs will be presented. A first challenge is represented by the implementation of a BS unit. The BS unit should be capable of firstly forming the wind farm power island and withstanding transient phenomena due to energisation. There could be several different solutions, e.g., the integration of grid-forming converters in the wind farm design which could be battery energy storage systems (BESSs). In this paper, specific challenges are analysed using simulations on a wind farm equipped with a grid-forming BESS, and the proposed solutions discussed. It can be concluded that a hybrid system comprised of a BESS and an OWF, in combination with novel technologies such as grid-forming control, soft-charging, etc. represents a feasible proposal for being able to provide BS services with OWFs.

This classification of bonds is performed on the basis of the equivalent hypothetical local strains and falls into three categories of horizontal normal, vertical normal, and shear bonds. While the classical Bond-Based PD (BB-PD) considers only the stretch of bonds, all components of the bonds' strains are taken into account in the proposed model.A local imaginary element is considered around each bond to estimate the true strains of each bond. The constitutive relations are derived from equating the strain energies of the bonds' deformations to the Classical Continuum Mechanics (CCM) strain energies for a generalized combined loading condition. A novel critical stretch criterion and critical angle criterion are proposed to predict the failure of normal and shear strain bonds, respectively.It is also shown that, unlike the classical BB-PD, the proposed model does not impose any limitations on the value of Poisson's ratio. The model is verified by investigating some intact plane stress and plane strain problems under mechanical and thermal loadings. Moreover, the deformation and damage contours and the corresponding stress-strain responses are presented for different problems with pre-existing defects and validated with the eXtended Finite Element method's (XFEM) analysis.

A key photoswitch is azobenzene, which exhibits trans-cis isomerism in response to light. The thermal half-life of the cis isomer is of crucial importance, since it controls the duration of the light-induced biological effect. Here we introduce a computational tool for predicting the thermal half-lives of azobenzene derivatives. Our automated approach uses a fast and accurate machine learning potential trained on quantum chemistry data. Building on well-established earlier evidence, we argue that thermal isomerization proceeds through rotation mediated by intersystem crossing, and incorporate this mechanism into our automated workflow. We use our approach to predict the thermal half-lives of 19,000 azobenzene derivatives. We explore trends and tradeoffs between barriers and absorption wavelengths, and open-source our data and software to accelerate research in photopharmacology.

In this paper, we focus on the challenge of accurate and real-time simulations for digital twins in the context of electrical machines. To build such a digital twin involves not only computational models for the electromagnetic aspects, but also mechanical and thermal effects need to be taken into account. We address mathematical tools that can be employed to carry out the required simulations based on physical laws as well as surrogate or data-driven models. One of those tools is a model hierarchy of very fine to very coarse models as well as reduced order models for obtaining real-time simulations. The required software tools to carry out simulations in the digital twin are also discussed. The simulation models are implemented in a pipeline that allows for the automatic modeling of new machines and the automatic configuration of new digital twins. Finally, the overall implemented digital twin is tested and implemented in a physical demonstrator.

Given the recent interest in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data-driven modeling, it is important to determine to what extent GANs can faithfully reproduce noise in target data sets. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation that aims to shed light on this issue for time series. Namely, we assess two general-purpose GANs for time series that are based on the popular deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture, a direct time-series model and an image-based model that uses a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) data representation. The GAN models are trained and quantitatively evaluated using distributions of simulated noise time series with known ground-truth parameters. Target time series distributions include a broad range of noise types commonly encountered in physical measurements, electronics, and communication systems: band-limited thermal noise, power law noise, shot noise, and impulsive noise. We find that GANs are capable of learning many noise types, although they predictably struggle when the GAN architecture is not well suited to some aspects of the noise, e.g., impulsive time-series with extreme outliers. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and potential limitations of current approaches to time-series GANs and highlight areas for further research. In addition, our battery of tests provides a useful benchmark to aid the development of deep generative models for time series.

Control via Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to significantly improve building energy efficiency, but existing solutions require access to building-specific simulators or data that cannot be expected for every building in the world. In response, we show it is possible to obtain emission-reducing policies without such knowledge a priori--a paradigm we call zero-shot building control. We combine ideas from system identification and model-based RL to create PEARL (Probabilistic Emission-Abating Reinforcement Learning) and show that a short period of active exploration is all that is required to build a performant model. In experiments across three varied building energy simulations, we show PEARL outperforms an existing RBC once, and popular RL baselines in all cases, reducing building emissions by as much as 31% whilst maintaining thermal comfort.

These battery systems consist of thousands of individual cells and various ancillary systems for monitoring and control. Although many studies have focused on the behaviour of single lithium-ion cells, the impact of system design choices and ancillary system controls on long-term degradation and efficiency of system, containing thousands of cells, has rarely been considered in detail. Here, we simulate a 1 MWh grid battery system consisting of 18900 individual cells, each represented by a separate electrochemical model, as well as the thermal management system and power electronic converters. Simulations of the impact of cell-to-cell variability, thermal effects, and degradation effects were run for up to 10000 cycles and 10 years. It is shown that electrical contact resistances and cell-to-cell variations in initial capacity and resistance have a smaller effect on performance than previously thought. Instead, the variation in degradation rate of individual cells dominates the system behaviour over the lifetime. The importance of careful thermal management system control is demonstrated, with proportional control improving overall efficiency by 5 %-pts over on-off methods, also increasing the total usable energy of the battery by 5 %-pts after 10 years.

Logically reversible gates provide a way to avoid these work costs, and also simplify the task of making the computation as a whole thermodynamically reversible. The inherent reversibility of mechanical logic gates would make them good candidates for the design of practical logically reversible computing systems if not for the relatively large size and mass of such systems. In this paper, we outline the design and simulation of reversible molecular mechanical logic gates that come close to the limits of thermodynamic reversibility even under the effects of thermal noise, and outline associated circuit components from which arbitrary combinatorial reversible circuits can be constructed and simulated. We demonstrate that isolated components can be operated in a thermodynamically reversible manner, and explore the complexities of combining components to implement more complex computations. Finally, we demonstrate a method to construct arbitrarily large reversible combinatorial circuits using multiple external controls and signal boosters with a working half-adder circuit.

Our approach is a generalization of now standard typicality algorithms for computing the quantum expectation value of observables of bare quantum systems via trace estimators and Krylov subspace methods. In particular, our algorithm makes use of the fact that the reduced system density, when the bath is measured in a given random state, tends to concentrate about the corresponding thermodynamic averaged reduced system density. Theoretical error analysis and numerical experiments are given to validate the accuracy of our algorithm. Further numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of our approach for applications including the study of quantum phase transitions and entanglement entropy for long-range interaction systems.

This is due to practical considerations related to delivering enough power to successfully site and operate these machines, as well as concerns about energy usage while running large simulations. Since obtaining accurate power measurements can be challenging, it may be tempting to use the processor thermal design power (TDP) as a surrogate due to its simplicity and availability. However, TDP is not indicative of typical power usage while running simulations. Using commodity and advanced technology systems at Lawrence Livermore and Sandia National Labs, we performed a series of experiments to measure power and energy usage in running simulation codes. These experiments indicate that large scale Lawrence Livermore simulation codes are significantly more efficient than a simple processor TDP model might suggest.

Thermal management is required in electronic systems to keep them from overheating and burning, enhancing their efficiency and lifespan. For a long time, numerical techniques have been employed to aid in the thermal management of electronics. However, they come with some limitations. To increase the effectiveness of traditional numerical approaches and address the drawbacks faced in conventional approaches, researchers have looked at using artificial intelligence at various stages of the thermal management process.

The methodology is based on the concepts of model order reduction and domain decomposition to construct a multi-block approach. A generic block model is built to represent a group of interconnect blocks that are used to wire standard cells in the integrated circuits (ICs). The blocks in this group possess identical geometry with various metal/via routings. The data-driven model reduction method is thus applied to learn material property variations induced by different metal/via routings in the blocks, in addition to the variations of heat sources and BCs. The approach is investigated in two very different settings. It is first applied to thermal simulation of a single interconnect block with similar BCs to those in the training of the generic block. It is then implemented in multi-block thermal simulation of a FinFET IC, where the interconnect structure is partitioned into several blocks each modeled by the generic block model. Accuracy of the generic block model is examined in terms of the metal/via routings, BCs and thermal discontinuities at the block interfaces.

The lack, if not complete absence, of interpretability for these so-called black-box models can lead to serious economic and ethical consequences, thereby hindering the development and deployment of AI in wider fields, particularly in those involving critical and regulatory applications. Yet, the building services industry is a highly-regulated domain requiring transparency and decision-making processes that can be understood and trusted by humans. To this end, the design and implementation of autonomous Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems for the automatic but concurrently interpretable optimisation of energy efficiency and room thermal comfort is of topical interest. This work therefore presents an interpretable machine learning model aimed at predicting room temperature in non-domestic buildings, for the purpose of optimising the use of the installed HVAC system. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed model can accurately forecast room temperatures eight hours ahead in real-time by taking into account historical RT information, as well as additional environmental and time-series features. In this paper, an enhanced feature engineering process is conducted based on the Exploratory Data Analysis results. Furthermore, beyond the commonly used Interpretable Machine Learning techniques, we propose a Permutation Feature-based Frequency Response Analysis (PF-FRA) method for quantifying the contributions of the different predictors in the frequency domain. Based on the generated reason codes, we find that the historical RT feature is the dominant factor that has most impact on the model prediction.

This is a deep learning based pioneering work since to the best of our knowledge, there exists no other work on thermal-optical grayscale fusion. Our method is also unique in the sense that the deep learning method we are proposing here works on the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) domain instead of the gray level domain. As a part of this work, we also present a new and unique database for obtaining the region of interest in thermal images based on an existing thermal visual paired database, containing the Region of Interest on 5 different classes of data. Finally, we are proposing a simple low cost overhead statistical measure for identifying the region of interest in the fused images, which we call as the Region of Fusion (RoF). Experiments on the database show encouraging results in identifying the region of interest in the fused images. We also show that they can be processed better in the mixed form rather than with only thermal images.

But as the power levels increase, the thermal conduction pathway from the heat source to the heat sink limits the effectiveness of these systems. In this work, we evaluate embedding the PCM within the silicon device layer of an electronic device to minimize the thermal resistance between the source and the PCM to minimize this thermal resistance and enhance the thermal performance of the device. The geometry and material properties of the embedded PCM regions are optimized using a combination of parametric and machine learning algorithms. For a fixed geometry, considering commercially available materials, Solder 174 significantly outperforms other organic and metallic PCMs. Also with a fixed geometry, the optimal melting points to minimize the peak temperature is higher than the optimal melting point to minimize the amplitude of the transient temperature oscillation, and both optima increase with increasing heater power. Extending beyond conventional optimization strategies, genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization with and without neural network surrogate models are used to enable optimization of many geometric and material properties. For the test case evaluated, the optimized geometries and properties are similar between all ML-assisted algorithms, but the computational time depends on the technique. Ultimately, the optimized design with embedded phase change materials reduces the maximum temperature rise by 19% and the fluctuations by up to 88% compared to devices without PCM.

This paper proposes a siamese infrared and visible light fusion Network (SiamIVFN) for RBG-T image-based tracking. SiamIVFN contains two main subnetworks: a complementary-feature-fusion network (CFFN) and a contribution-aggregation network (CAN). CFFN utilizes a two-stream multilayer convolutional structure whose filters for each layer are partially coupled to fuse the features extracted from infrared images and visible light images. CFFN is a feature-level fusion network, which can cope with the misalignment of the RGB-T image pairs. Through adaptively calculating the contributions of infrared and visible light features obtained from CFFN, CAN makes the tracker robust under various light conditions. Experiments on two RGB-T tracking benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SiamIVFN has achieved state-of-the-art performance. The tracking speed of SiamIVFN is 147.6FPS, the current fastest RGB-T fusion tracker.

The high fidelity full solutions are obtained by discretizing the RTSWE in space with skew-symmetric finite-differences, that preserve the Hamiltonian structure. The resulting skew-gradient system is integrated in time with the energy preserving average vector field (AVF) method. The reduced-order model (ROM) is constructed in the same way as the full order model (FOM), preserving the reduced skew-symmetric structure and integrating in time with the AVF method. Relying on structure-preserving discretizations in space and time and applying proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with the Galerkin projection, an energy preserving reduced order model (ROM) is constructed. The nonlinearities in the ROM are computed by applying the discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) method to reduce the computational cost. The computation of the reduced-order solutions is accelerated further by the use of tensor techniques. The overall procedure yields a clear separation of the offline and online computational cost of the reduced solutions. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the ROMs are demonstrated for a numerical test problem. Preservation of the energy (Hamiltonian), and other conserved quantities, i.e. mass, buoyancy, and total vorticity show that the reduced-order solutions ensure the long-term stability of the solutions while exhibiting several orders of magnitude computational speedup over the FOM.

Standard atmosphere-ocean coupled numerical models provide accurate sea-surface forecasts on the scale of a few days to a few weeks, but many important weather systems require greater foresight. In this paper we propose machine-learning approaches sea-surface temperature forecasting that are accurate on the scale of dozens of weeks. Our approach is based in Koopman operator theory, a useful tool for dynamical systems modelling. With this approach, we predict sea surface temperature in the Gulf of Mexico up to 180 days into the future based on a present image of thermal conditions and three years of historical training data. We evaluate the combination of a basic Koopman method with a convolutional autoencoder, and a newly proposed "consistent Koopman" method, in various permutations. We show that the Koopman approach consistently outperforms baselines, and we discuss the utility of our additional assumptions and methods in this sea-surface temperature domain.

This result holds whenever the temperature is greater than four plus twice the maximum interaction degree (valence) over all qubits, measured in units of the local coupling strength. For example, this implies that the classical simulation of the thermal state of a superconducting device modeling a frustrated quantum Ising model with maximum valence of 6 and coupling strengths of 1 GHz is always possible at temperatures above 800 mK. Despite the quantum system being at high temperature, the classical spin system resulting from the quantum-to-classical mapping contains strong couplings which cause the single-site Glauber dynamics to mix slowly, therefore this result depends on the use of worldline updates (which are a form of cluster updates that can be implemented efficiently). This result places definite constraints on the temperatures required for a quantum advantage in analog quantum simulation with various NISQ devices based on equilibrium states of quantum Ising models.

We take into account the interfacial hydrodynamic coupling, traction coupling with the surrounding bulk fluid, and thermal fluctuations. For fluid-structure interactions, we introduce Immersed Boundary Methods (IBM) and related Stochastic Eulerian-Lagrangian Methods (SELM) for curved surfaces. We use these approaches to investigate the statistics of surface fluctuating hydrodynamics and microstructures. For velocity autocorrelations, we find characteristic power-law scalings $Ï^{-1}$, $Ï^{-2}$, and plateaus can emerge. This depends on the physical regime associated with the geometry, surface viscosity, and bulk viscosity. This differs from the characteristic $Ï^{-3/2}$ scaling for bulk three dimensional fluids. We develop theory explaining these observed power-laws associated with time-scales for dissipation within the fluid interface and coupling to the surrounding fluid. We then use our introduced methods to investigate a few example systems and roles of hydrodynamic coupling and thermal fluctuations including for the kinetics of passive particles and active microswimmers in curved fluid interfaces.

The proposed ANN estimator is novel in the sense that his estimates simultaneously temperature, speed and rotor resistance based only on the measurement of the voltage and current inputs. Many types of ANN estimators have been designed by a lot of researchers during the last two decades. Each type is designed for a specific application. The thermal behavior of the motor is very slow, which leads to large amounts of data sets. The standard ANN use often Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with Levenberg-Marquardt Backpropagation (LMBP), among the limits of LMBP in the case of large number of data, so the use of MLP based on LMBP is no longer valid in our case. As solution, we propose the use of Cascade-Forward Neural Network (CFNN) based Bayesian Regulation backpropagation (BRBP). To test our estimator robustness a random white-Gaussian noise has been added to the sets. The proposed estimator is in our viewpoint accurate and robust.

Therefore, it is crucial to design some energy-efficient building thermal control policies which can reduce the energy consumption of HVAC while maintaining the comfort of the occupants. However, implementing such a policy is challenging, because it involves various influencing factors in a building environment, which are usually hard to model and may be different from case to case. To address this challenge, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based framework for energy optimization and thermal comfort control in smart buildings. We formulate the building thermal control as a cost-minimization problem which jointly considers the energy consumption of HVAC and the thermal comfort of the occupants. To solve the problem, we first adopt a deep neural network based approach for predicting the occupants' thermal comfort, and then adopt Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) for learning the thermal control policy. To evaluate the performance, we implement a building thermal control simulation system and evaluate the performance under various settings. The experiment results show that our method can improve the thermal comfort prediction accuracy, and reduce the energy consumption of HVAC while improving the occupants' thermal comfort.

First, a generalized state variable referred to as degree of satisfaction (DoS) is defined, and dynamic models with a unified form are derived for different types of GESs. Second, a real-time market-based coordination framework is proposed to facilitate control, and ensure user privacy and device security. Demand curves of different GESs are then developed based on DoS to express their demand urgencies as well as flexibilities. Furthermore, a low-dimensional aggregate dynamic model of a GES cluster is derived thanks to the DoS-equality control feature provided by the design of demand curve. At last, an optimization model for a large-scale GESs to participate in both the energy market and regulation market is established based on the aggregate model. Simulations results demonstrate that the optimization algorithm could effectively reduce the total cost of an aggregator. Additionally, the proposed coordination method has high tracking accuracy and could well satisfy users' diversified power demand.

For these applications, the battery should perform reliably and pose no safety threats. However, the performance of Li-ion batteries can be affected by abnormal thermal behaviors, defined as faults. It is essential to develop reliable thermal management system to accurately predict and monitor thermal behaviors of Li-ion battery. Using the first-principle models of batteries, this work presents a stochastic fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithm to identify two particular faults in the Li-ion battery cells, using easily measured quantities such as temperatures. Models of Li-ion battery are typically derived from the underlying physical phenomena. To make model tractable and useful, it is common to make simplifications during model development, which may consequently introduce mismatch between models and battery cells. Further, FDD algorithms can be affected by uncertainty, which may originate from either intrinsic time varying phenomena or model calibration with noisy data. A two-step FDD algorithm is developed in this work to correct model of Li-ion battery cells and to identify faulty operations from a normal operating condition. An iterative optimization problem is proposed to correct the model by incorporating the errors between measured quantities and model predictions, which is followed by an optimization-based FDD to provide a probabilistic description of the occurrence of possible faults, while taking the uncertainty into account. The two-step stochastic FDD algorithm in this work is shown to be efficient in terms of fault detection rate for both individual and simultaneous faults in Li-ion batteries, as compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

The respective models are the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and the nonlinear heat equation. A partitioned coupling approach via a Dirichlet-Neumann method and a fixed point iteration is employed. As a refence solver a previously developed efficient time adaptive higher order time integration scheme is used.
  To improve upon this, we work on reducing the number of fixed point coupling iterations. Thus, first widely used vector extrapolation methods for convergence acceleration of the fixed point iteration are tested. In particular, Aitken relaxation, minimal polynomial extrapolation (MPE) and reduced rank extrapolation (RRE) are considered. Second, we explore the idea of extrapolation based on data given from the time integration and derive such methods for SDIRK2. While the vector extrapolation methods have no beneficial effects, the extrapolation methods allow to reduce the number of fixed point iterations further by up to a factor of two with linear extrapolation performing better than quadratic.

To account for thermal fluctuations, we introduce a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance condition to develop compatible stochastic driving fields for our discretization. We perform analysis that shows our condition is sufficient to ensure results consistent with statistical mechanics. We show the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution is invariant under the stochastic dynamics of the semi-discretization. To generate efficiently the required stochastic driving fields, we develop a Gibbs sampler based on iterative methods and multigrid to generate fields with $O(N)$ computational complexity. Our stochastic methods provide an alternative to uniform discretizations on periodic domains that rely on Fast Fourier Transforms. To demonstrate in practice our stochastic computational methods, we investigate within channel geometries having internal obstacles and no-slip walls how the mobility/diffusivity of particles depends on location. Our methods extend the applicability of fluctuating hydrodynamic approaches by allowing for spatially adaptive resolution of the mechanics and for domains that have complex geometries relevant in many applications.

We derive effective equations using a singular perturbation analysis of the Backward Kolmogorov equations of the stochastic process. Our continuum mechanics description is based on the Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Method (SELM) which provides a framework for approximation of the fluid-structure interactions when subject to thermal fluctuations.

In Alaska, the warming of the topmost permafrost layer, known as the active layer, signals elevated greenhouse gas release due to high carbon storage. Accurate soil temperature prediction is therefore essential for risk mitigation and stability assessment; however, many existing approaches overlook the numerous factors driving soil thermal dynamics. This study presents a proof-of-concept latitude-based deep learning pipeline for modeling yearly soil temperatures across multiple depths. The framework employs dynamic reanalysis feature data from the ERA5-Land dataset, static geologic and lithological features, sliding-window sequences for seasonal context, a derived scenario signal feature for long-term climate forcing, and latitude band embeddings for spatial sensitivity. Five deep learning models were tested: a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a Transformer, a 1-Dimensional Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (Conv1DLSTM), a Gated-Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM). Results showed solid recognition of latitudinal and depth-wise temperature discrepancies, with the GRU performing best in sequential temperature pattern detection. Bias-corrected CMIP5 RCP data enabled recognition of sinusoidal temperature trends, though limited divergence between scenarios were observed. This study establishes an end-to-end framework for adopting deep learning in active layer temperature modeling, offering seasonal, spatial, and vertical temperature context without intrinsic restrictions on feature selection.

One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the Rényi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $α$-$z$, and geometric Rényi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $α$, the log-Euclidean Rényi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric Rényi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $α$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $α$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $α$-$z$ Rényi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states and time-evolved states, I establish formulas for their $α$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.

Within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer, training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer would generate an idealized dynamical trajectory. The idealized trajectory is designed to reproduce the activations of a neural network trained to perform the desired computation. This teacher-student scheme results in a thermodynamic computer whose finite-time dynamics enacts a computation analogous to that of the neural network. The parameters identified in this way can be implemented in the hardware realization of the thermodynamic computer, which will perform the desired computation automatically, driven by thermal noise. We demonstrate the method on a standard image-classification task, and estimate the thermodynamic advantage -- the ratio of energy costs of the digital and thermodynamic implementations -- to exceed seven orders of magnitude. Our results establish gradient descent as a viable training method for thermodynamic computing, enabling application of the core methodology of machine learning to this emerging field.

However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image, Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation, and other autonomy settings.

As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown, when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.

This study asks whether a structure-aware graph neural network (GNN; DimeNet++) trained on GERG-2008/CoolProp data can act as a practical surrogate for an equation of state (EoS). We generate a ternary dataset over 90-200 K and pressures to 100 bar, curate it with a 15% density filter (reducing 5,200 states to 1,516), and pair each state with a lightweight molecular-dynamics snapshot to supply structural features. The model is trained in two stages; pretraining on residual Helmholtz energy followed by pressure fine-tuning with a stability penalty; and evaluated via single-phase interpolation tests, solver-free derivative-quality diagnostics, an audited VLE driver, and a latency benchmark. Within its regime, the GNN interpolates single-phase properties reasonably well; however, the VLE driver accepts no GNN equilibria on tested binaries (all plotted VLE points are CoolProp fallback or the solver fails), and diagnostic probes reveal jagged P(V|T) paths and thermal-stability flags concentrated in dense/cold regions, indicating insufficient derivative smoothness/consistency for robust equilibrium solving. An end-to-end timing comparison shows no single-phase speed advantage relative to CoolProp (tens of milliseconds vs sub-millisecond). We conclude that, as configured, the surrogate in this study is not solver-ready for VLE and offers no runtime benefit; its value is methodological, delineating failure modes and pointing to remedies such as physics-informed training signals and targeted coverage near phase boundaries.

This study presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared imagery with comprehensive ground-truth annotations, provides an unprecedented resource for training robust burned area detection models. We trained our model with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) dataset in the contiguous US and evaluated it with 17 regions cross in Europe. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and high generalization in burned area mapping.

The transmission employs M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) modulation over an optical channel impaired by thermal noise, and the fundamental detection performance is evaluated using the Helstrom bound. An optimization framework is proposed that jointly determines the optimal quantum measurement and the energy-harvesting time fraction to maximize the effective rate under a block time constraint. Analytical expressions are derived for special cases, while semidefinite programming techniques are employed for the general M-PSK scenario. Numerical results validate the unimodal nature of the effective rate function and demonstrate the impact of the optimal design parameters.

While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures. However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

Time fractional extensions of Fisher's equation have also appeared in the literature, aiming to model systems with memory. The solution of the time fractional Fisher-KPP equation is challenging due to the interplay between the nonlinearity and the nonlocality imposed by the fractional derivatives. An accurate method that for the solution of time fractional diffusion problems is the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The conventional BEM has a high computational cost and memory requirements since it leads to dense coefficient matrices. For nonlinear transient problems, its efficiency is further reduced due to the appearance of volume integrals. In the present work an extension of the recently proposed Local Domain Boundary Element Method (LD-BEM) is presented for the solution of nonlinear time fractional Fisher-KPP problems. The implemented numerical method is used to examine various two-dimensional problems related to the Fisher-KPP equation using different definitions of the fractional derivative.

This first wave of direct-to-device (D2D) demonstrations validated the physical feasibility of satellite-based mobile access. However, these systems remain fallback-grade--rural-only, bandwidth-limited, and fully dependent on Earth-based mobile cores for identity, session, and policy control. This paper asks a more ambitious question: Can a complete mobile network, including radio access, core functions, traffic routing, and content delivery, operate entirely from orbit? And can it deliver sustained, urban-grade service in the world's densest cities? We present the first end-to-end system architecture for a fully orbital telco, integrating electronically steered phased arrays with 1000-beam capacity, space-based deployment of 5G core functions (UPF, AMF), and inter-satellite laser mesh backhaul. We analyze spectral efficiency, beam capacity, and link budgets under dense urban conditions, accounting for path loss, Doppler, and multipath. Simulations show that rooftop and line-of-sight users can sustain 64-QAM throughput, while street-level access is feasible with relay or assisted beam modes. The paper outlines the remaining constraints, power, thermal dissipation, compute radiation hardening, and regulatory models, and demonstrates that these are engineering bottlenecks, not physical limits. Finally, we propose a staged 15-year roadmap from today's fallback D2D systems to autonomous orbital overlays delivering 50-100 Mbps to handhelds in megacities, with zero reliance on terrestrial infrastructure.

Current climate models and environmental protocols almost entirely overlook the impact of information and communication technologies on the thermal and energy balance of the biosphere.
  This paper proposes the theory of information and climate feedback (ICF) as a new nonlinear model describing the loop of digitalization, energy consumption, the thermal footprint, the climatic response, and the vulnerability of digital infrastructure. The system is formalized via differential equations with delays and parameters of sensitivity, greenness, and phase stability.
  A multiscenario numerical analysis, phase reconstructions, and thermal cartography were conducted. Critical regimes, including digital overheating, fluctuational instability, and infrastructural collapse in the absence of adaptive measures, were identified.
  The paper concludes with the proposal of an international agreement titled the Green Digital Accord and a set of metrics for sustainable digitalization. This work integrates climatology, information technologies, and the political economy of sustainability.

This study develops and evaluates predictive models for effluent temperature in the upper recharge layer of a Shafdan SAT system recharge basin using ambient meteorological data. Multiple linear regression (MLR), neural networks (NN), and random forests (RF) were tested for their predictive accuracy and interpretability. The MLR model, preferred for its operational simplicity and robust performance, achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.86-0.87) and was used to estimate effluent temperatures over a 10-year period. Results highlight pronounced seasonal temperature cycles and the importance of topsoil temperature in governing the thermal profile of the infiltrating effluent. The study provides practical equations for real-time monitoring and long-term planning of SAT operations.

This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical framework that reconceptualizes Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) to accommodate these extreme dynamics through a four-layer hierarchical control architecture operating across timescales from 100 microseconds to 24 hours.
  We develop control mechanisms and stability criteria specifically tailored to converter-dominated systems with pulsing megawatt-scale loads. We prove that traditional VPP architectures, designed for aggregating distributed resources with response times of seconds to minutes, cannot maintain stability when confronted with AI data center dynamics exhibiting slew rates exceeding 1,000 MW/s at gigawatt scale.
  Our framework introduces: (1) a sub-millisecond control layer that interfaces with data center power electronics to actively dampen power oscillations; (2) new stability criteria incorporating protection system dynamics, demonstrating that critical clearing times reduce from 150 ms to 83 ms for gigawatt-scale pulsing loads; and (3) quantified flexibility characterization showing that workload deferability enables 30% peak reduction while maintaining AI service availability above 99.95%.
  This work establishes the mathematical foundations necessary for the stable integration of AI infrastructure that will constitute 50-70% of data center electricity consumption by 2030.

This problem is not as simple as it looks because of system constraints that cannot be neglected practically. Moreover, increased awareness of clean technology imposes another important limit on the emission of pollutants obtained from burning of fossil fuels. Classical optimization methods lack the ability of solving such a complex and multi-objective problem. Hence, various modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques based on evolution and social behaviour of organisms are being used to solve such problems because they are easier to implement, give accurate results and take less computational time. In this work, a study is done on most of the contemporary basic AI techniques being used in literature for power systems in general and combined economic emission dispatch (CEED) in particular. The dispatch problem is implemented on IEEE 30-bus benchmarked system in MATLAB for different load demands considering all gases (COX, NOX and SOX) using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) and their results are compared with each other.

Departing from conventional reward-driven paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision. Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

To ensure continuous and reliable operation without undesirable malfunctions, it is essential to monitor the internal temperatures of machines and keep them within safe operating limits. Conventional modeling methods can be complex and usually require expert knowledge. With the amount of data collected these days, it is possible to use information models to assess thermal behaviors. This paper investigates artificial intelligence techniques for monitoring the cooling efficiency of induction machines. Experimental data was collected under specific operating conditions, and three machine-learning models have been developed. The optimal configuration for each approach was determined through rigorous hyperparameter searches, and the models were evaluated using a variety of metrics. The three solutions performed well in monitoring the condition of the machine even under transient operation, highlighting the potential of data-driven methods in improving the thermal management.

As the location of updrafts is uncertain and cannot be determined except through in situ observation, aircraft exploiting this energy source are at risk of failing to find a subsequent updraft. Determining when an updraft must be exploited to continue flight is essential to managing risk and optimizing speed. Graph percolation offers a theoretical explanation for this risk, and a framework for evaluating it using information available to the operator of a soaring aircraft in flight. The utility of graph percolation as a risk measure is examined by analyzing flight logs from human soaring pilots. This analysis indicates that in sport soaring pilots rarely operate in a condition which does not satisfy graph percolation, identifies an apparent desired minimum node degree, and shows that pilots accept reduced climb rates in order to maintain percolation.

The Kelvin-Voigt rheology or also, in the deviatoric part, the Jeffreys rheology (covering creep or plasticity) are considered, using the additive Green-Naghdi's decomposition of total strain into the elastic and the inelastic strains formulated in terms of (objective) rates exploiting the Zaremba-Jaumann time derivative. A linearized convective model at large displacements is considered, focusing on the case where the internal energy additively splits the (convex) mechanical and the thermal parts. The time-discrete suitably regularized scheme is devised. The numerical stability and, considering the multipolar 2nd-grade viscosity, also convergence towards weak solutions are proved, exploiting the convexity of the kinetic energy when written in terms of linear momentum instead of velocity and estimating the temperature gradient from the entropy-like inequality.

Micro/nanoscale thermal mapping requires precise techniques such as thermocouples, resistance-based devices, infrared thermography, optical interferometry, Raman thermometry, and Time domain-thermoreflectance (TDTR) method. Each method has its advantages and limitations, emphasizing the importance of selecting the appropriate technique. Among these methods, micro-thin film thermocouples (TFTCs) offer a compelling solution due to their direct contact-based temperature measurements, minimal surface preparation requirements, lower cost, and robustness against environmental factors. Thermocouples work on the well-established Seebeck effect, where a voltage is generated proportional to the temperature difference between two points. However, at micro/nanoscale, the Seebeck coefficients of thermocouples differ from those in bulk materials, requiring experimental calibration for precise measurements. To address this, we introduce an on-chip characterization platform with a differential temperature measurement setup on a borosilicate glass substrate. This platform utilizes a microheater as a localized heat source to elevate the temperature at the hot junction of the TFTC while maintaining the cold junction at ambient conditions. Numerical simulations are employed to engineer both the microheater and TFTC junction for precise temperature control. The functionality of this platform is validated by fabricating TFTCs using standard fabrication processes and measuring the TFTC response to determine the differential Seebeck coefficient of a Platinum-Chromium TFTC Junction. The calculated sensitivity of Pt/Cr TFTCs using this calibration method is 19.23 +- 0.405 Î¼V/C.

We distinguish between two classes of analog systems: dynamic and quasi-static. In dynamic systems, energy dissipation arises from neuron resets, with a lower bound governed by Landauer's principle. To analyse a quasi-static analog platform, we construct an explicit mapping of a generic feedforward DNN onto a physical system described by a model Hamiltonian. In this framework, inference can proceed reversibly, with no minimum free energy cost imposed by thermodynamics. We further analyze the training process in quasi-static analog networks and derive a fundamental lower bound on its energy cost, rooted in the interplay between thermal and statistical noise. Our results suggest that while analog implementations can outperform digital ones during inference, the thermodynamic cost of training scales similarly in both paradigms.

This work presents a novel approach to determine the properties using uncertainty quantification simulations. We quantify uncertainty in the material properties for effective insulation by proposing a Bayesian distribution for them. Sampling from this distribution is performed using Monte Carlo simulations, which require repeatedly solving the predictive thermal model. To address the computational inefficiency of conventional numerical simulations, we develop a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the heat transfer problem. The proposed PINN significantly reduces computational time while maintaining accuracy, as verified against traditional numerical solutions. Additionally, we used the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method to enable vectorized and parallel computations, further enhancing computational speedup. Our results demonstrate that integrating MCMC with PINN decreases computational time substantially compared to using standard numerical methods. Moreover, combining the SMC method with PINN yields multifold computational speedup, making this approach highly effective for the rapid and accurate estimation of material properties.

We apply computational modeling and principles in physics and chemistry to estimate different thermal and electric properties of a water-vapor/nitrogen/cesium-vapor (H2O/N2/Cs) gas mixture with different levels of cesium (Cs) at a fixed temperature of 2300 K (2026.85 Â°C). This gas mixture and temperature are selected because they resemble the stoichiometric combustion of hydrogen with air, followed by the addition of the alkali metal element cesium to allow ionization, thus converting the gas mixture into electrically conducting plasma. We vary the cesium mole fraction in the gas mixture by two orders of magnitude, from a minute amount of 0.0625% (1/1600) to a major amount of 16% (0.16). We use these results to further estimate the theoretical upper limit of the electric power output from a unit volume of a high-speed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel, with the plasma accelerated inside it to twice the local speed of sound (Mach number 2) while subject to an applied magnetic field of 5 T (5 teslas). We report that there is an optimum cesium mole fraction of 3%, at which the power output is maximized. Per 1 m3 of plasma volume, the estimated theoretical electric power generation at 1 atm (101.325 kPa) pressure of the hydrogen-combustion mixture is extraordinarily high at 360 MW/m3, and the plasma electric conductivity is 17.5 S/m. This estimated power generation even reaches an impressive level of 1.15 GW/m3 (11500 MW/m3) if the absolute pressure can be decreased to 0.0625 atm (6.333 kPa), at which the electric conductivity exceeds 55 S/m (more than 10 times the electric conductivity of seawater).

This study examines the thermal characteristics of various building types across different functional areas, utilizing the concept of body coefficient to integrate their unique structural and energy use traits into a demand response framework supported by real-time pricing. We developed a Stackelberg game-based bi-level optimization model that captures the dynamic interplay of costs and benefits between integrated energy providers and users. This model is formulated into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and linearized with the Big M method, subsequently solved using MATLAB and CPLEX. This approach enables distinctive management of heating loads in public and residential areas, optimizing energy efficiency while balancing the interests of both providers and users. Furthermore, the study explores how the proportion of different area types affects the potential for reducing heat loads, providing insights into the scalability and effectiveness of demand response strategies in integrated energy systems. This analysis not only highlights the economic benefits of such strategies but also their potential in reducing dependency on traditional energy sources, thus contributing to more sustainable energy system practices.

Our use of an ultra-low-resolution thermal camera instead of other modalities such as an RGB camera is motivated by its robustness to lighting conditions, while being one order of magnitude less cost-expensive compared to higher-resolution thermal cameras. After setting up a custom data acquisition system and acquiring thermal camera data together with its associated rotational speed label, we train a small 4-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regressing the rotational speed from the thermal data. Experiments and ablation studies are conducted for determining the impact of thermal camera resolution and the number of successive frames on the CNN estimation precision. Finally, our novel dataset for the study of low-resolution thermal odometry is openly released with the hope of benefiting future research.

Using the proposed finite element formulation, the TED quality factor is obtained for 1-D rod undergoing longitudinal vibrations using the eigenvalue analysis. We first validate the accuracy of the finite element implementation with previously known theoretical and numerical results. Subsequently we demonstrate the utility of the proposed numerical framework to study the effect of geometric nonlinearity, temperature and strain dependent material nonlinearity on the thermoelastic damping.In addition, the effect of internal/ external heating and different thermal boundary conditions on TED is discussed

To describe the long-time dynamics of such systems, which is responsible for their most informative characteristics, we can identify a few slow collective variables (CVs) while treating the remaining fast variables as thermal noise. This enables us to simplify the dynamics and treat it as diffusion in a free-energy landscape spanned by slow CVs, effectively rendering the dynamics Markovian. Our recent statistical learning technique, spectral map [Rydzewski, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 22, 5216-5220], explores this strategy to learn slow CVs by maximizing a spectral gap of a transition matrix. In this work, we introduce several advancements into our framework, using a high-dimensional reversible folding process of a protein as an example. We implement an algorithm for coarse-graining Markov transition matrices to partition the reduced space of slow CVs kinetically and use it to define a transition state ensemble. We show that slow CVs learned by spectral map closely approach the Markovian limit for an overdamped diffusion. We demonstrate that coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficients only slightly affect the constructed free-energy landscapes. Finally, we present how spectral map can be used to quantify the importance of features and compare slow CVs with structural descriptors commonly used in protein folding. Overall, we demonstrate that a single slow CV learned by spectral map can be used as a physical reaction coordinate to capture essential characteristics of protein folding.

The research combines numerical modeling of the AFSD process with genetic algorithm-optimized machine learning models to predict von Mises stress and logarithmic strain. Finite element analysis was employed to simulate the AFSD process for five aluminum alloys: AA2024, AA5083, AA5086, AA7075, and AA6061, capturing complex thermal and mechanical interactions. A dataset of 200 samples was generated from these simulations. Subsequently, Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) regression models, optimized using genetic algorithms, were developed to predict key mechanical properties. The GA-RF model demonstrated superior performance in predicting both von Mises stress (R square = 0.9676) and logarithmic strain (R square = 0.7201). This innovative approach provides a powerful tool for understanding and optimizing the AFSD process across multiple aluminum alloys, offering insights into material behavior under various process parameters.

By starting from a fully discrete linear finite element scheme, we do not only prove the well-posedness of the model, but also provide a practicable and convergent scheme for its numerical treatment. Conceptually, our discrete scheme relies on a recently developed augmentation of the scalar auxiliary variable approach, which reduces the requirements on the time regularity of the solution. By showing that fully discrete solutions to this scheme satisfy an energy estimate, we obtain first uniform regularity results. Establishing Nikolskii estimates with respect to time, we are able to show convergence towards pathwise unique martingale solutions by applying Jakubowski's generalization of Skorokhod's theorem. Finally, a generalization of the GyÃ¶ngy--Krylov characterization of convergence in probability provides convergence towards strong solutions and thereby completes the proof.

Neutral carrier gases serve as the bulk fluid that carries the seed material, as well as the electrons generated by the partial thermal (equilibrium) ionization of the seed alkali metal. The model accounts for electron-neutral scattering, as well as electron-ion and electron-electron scattering. The model is tested through comparison with published data. The model is aimed at being utilized for the plasma within magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channels, where direct power extraction from passing electrically conducting plasma gas enables electric power generation. The thermal ionization model is then used to estimate the electric conductivity of seeded combustion gases under complete combustion of three selected fuels, namely: hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and carbon (C). For each of these three fuels, two options for the oxidizer were applied, namely: air (21 % molecular oxygen, 79 % molecular nitrogen by mole), and pure oxygen (oxy-combustion). Two types of seeds (with 1 % mole fraction, based on the composition before ionization) were also applied for each of the six combinations of (fuel-oxidizer), leading to a total of 12 different MHD plasma cases. For each of these cases, the electric conductivity was computed for a range of temperatures from 2000 K to 3000 K. The smallest estimated electric conductivity was 0.35 S/m for oxy-hydrogen combustion at 2000 K, with potassium seeding. The largest estimated electric conductivity was 180.30 S/m for oxy-carbon combustion at 3000 K, with cesium seeding. At 2000 K, replacing potassium with cesium causes a gain in the electric conductivity by a multiplicative gain factor of about 3.6 regardless of the fuel and oxidizer. This gain factor declines to between 1.77 and 2.07 at 3000 K.

A hollow cuboid vapour chamber model was investigated. The space within the hollow cuboid was used as the design space. COMSOL, a FEM software product was used to solve for the physical parameters of each geometry for the heat dissipation system design space. COMSOL in conjunction with MATLAB was used for the parametric and density-based topology optimisation of the geometric design in the design space. The goal of the optimization is the minimisation of a temperature gradient over the design space. This allows the heat to be evenly spread throughout the designed mesh which allows for more effective cooling. To reduce the computational time needed to solve and optimise each geometry in 3D, a 2D representation was created for the front and rear faces of the hollow cuboid setup. These 2D face designs were then extrapolated into 3D over the length of the hollow cube and COMSOL was used to find a solution for each model. This report also proposes a use case for this system wherein it would be used in conjunction with MGA and thermometric technology within coal-fired power stations for the extraction and storage of waste heat for later use.

Understanding the dynamics of interacting continental plates is thus significant. In this work, we present a fluid mechanical investigation of the plate motion, interaction, and dynamics. Through numerical experiments, we examine the coupling between a convective fluid and plates floating on top of it. With physical modeling, we show the coupling is both mechanical and thermal, leading to the thermal blanket effect: the floating plate is not only transported by the fluid flow beneath, it also prevents the heat from leaving the fluid, leading to a convective flow that further affects the plate motion. By adding several plates to such a coupled fluid-structure interaction, we also investigate how floating plates interact with each other and show that, under proper conditions, small plates can converge into a supercontinent.

We present the derivation of the strong and weak forms of the model, as well as the discretization procedure in space and in time. The discretized model is computationally solved in two dimensions by means of a finite element method that employs $hp$ layered meshes, along with staggered second order semi-implicit time integration. The expected error estimate is of higher order than any other similar work, both in space and in time. A representative battery cell geometry, under distinct operating scenarios, is simulated. The numerical results show that the full model allows for important additional insights to be drawn than when caring only for the electrochemical coupling. Considering the multiphysics becomes more important as the applied current is increased, whether for discharge or for charge.

First, cuda kernels for the two algorithms are written. These kernels are compiled and executed with the GPGPU Simulator to extract power logs for varying tensor sizes. These power logs are converted to ptrace files with an automation script written in Python. The 3D floor plan, along with the generated ptrace files are given to HotSpot, which generates thermal heat maps to show heat dissipation for various components of the Fermi architecture. These heat dissipation trends for both the kernels are observed for multiple tensor sizes to draw qualitative conclusions. The behavioral and execution patterns of both kernels are also observed with these varying heat dissipation trends. With this project, we observe that an increase in tensor size results in an increase of heat dissipation in components of the Fermi Architecture. However, the temperature of the chip remains saturated after a particular tensor size and remains constant thereafter. Heat dissipation is non-uniform with smaller tensor sizes, and becomes more uniform after a certain tensor size. This means, that after a particular tensor size, more cores of the architecture get activated in the computations, thereby resulting in an almost constant temperature. We also observe that Needleman Wunsch uses more data movement between DRAM and caches, thereby showing higher heat dissipation patterns in DRAMs when compared to Matrix multiplication for the same tensor size. Our observations are in accordance with the theoretical concepts behind the working of the two algorithms, thereby making our results consistent.

The surrogate model is constructed using a Gaussian process regression (GPR). To ensure conservativeness, two new approaches are proposed: the first one using bootstrapping, and the second one using concentration inequalities. Those two techniques are based on a stochastic argument and thus will only enforce conservativeness up to a user-defined probability threshold. The method has applications in the context of optimization using the active subspace method for dimensionality reduction of the objective function and the constraints, addressing recorded issues about constraint violations. The resulting algorithms are tested on a toy optimization problem in thermal design.

Phase space engineering technologies utilizing externally injected electromagnetic fields can be applied to meet the challenge of maintaining non-thermal particle distributions at a reasonable cost. The physical processes of the phase space engineering are studied from a theoretical and algorithmic perspective. It is emphasized that the operational space of phase space engineering is limited by the underpinning symplectic dynamics of charged particles. The phase space incompressibility according to the Liouville theorem is just one of many constraints, and Gromov's non-squeezing theorem determines the minimum footprints of the charged particles on every conjugate phase space plane. In this sense and level of sophistication, the mathematical abstraction of phase space engineering is symplectic topology. To simulate the processes of phase space engineering, such as the Maxwell demon and electromagnetic energy extraction, and to accurately calculate the minimum footprints of charged particles, recently developed structure-preserving geometric algorithms can be used. The family of algorithms conserves exactly, on discretized spacetime, symplecticity and thus incompressibility, non-squeezability, and symplectic capacities. The algorithms apply to the dynamics of charged particles under the influence of external electromagnetic fields as well as the charged particle-electromagnetic field system governed by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations.

Notably, infrared thermography has emerged as a valuable tool in breast cancer screening and clinical breast examination (CBE). Measuring heterogeneous thermal patterns is the key to incorporating computational dynamic thermography, which can be achieved by matrix factorization techniques. These approaches focus on extracting the predominant thermal patterns from the entire thermal sequence. Yet, the task of singling out the dominant image that effectively represents the prevailing temporal changes remains a challenging pursuit within the field of computational thermography. In this context, we propose applying James-Stein for eigenvector (JSE) and Weibull embedding approaches, as two novel strategies in response to this challenge. The primary objective is to create a low-dimensional (LD) representation of the thermal data stream. This LD approximation serves as the foundation for extracting thermomics and training a classification model with optimized hyperparameters, for early breast cancer detection. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various embedding adjuncts to matrix factorization methods. The results of the proposed method indicate an enhancement in the projection of the predominant basis vector, yielding classification accuracy of 81.7% (+/-5.2%) using Weibull embedding, which outperformed other embedding approaches we proposed previously. In comparison analysis, Sparse PCT and Deep SemiNMF showed the highest accuracies having 80.9% and 78.6%, respectively. These findings suggest that JSE and Weibull embedding techniques substantially help preserve crucial thermal patterns as a biomarker leading to improved CBE and enabling the very early detection of breast cancer.

The performance of underlying NoiseMod schemes is evaluated under both additive white Gaussian and fading channels and alternative NoiseMod designs exploiting non-coherent detection and time diversity are proposed. Extensive numerical and computer simulation results are presented to validate our designs and theoretical derivations.

However, what if there is gold in that garbage? In conventional engineering, our focus is primarily on eliminating, suppressing, combating, or even ignoring noise and its detrimental impacts. Conversely, could we exploit it similarly to biology, which utilizes noise-alike carrier signals to convey information? In this context, the utilization of noise, or noise-alike signals in general, has been put forward as a means to realize unconditionally secure communication systems in the future. In this tutorial article, we begin by tracing the origins of thermal noise-based communication and highlighting one of its significant applications for ensuring unconditionally secure networks: the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key exchange scheme. We then delve into the inherent challenges tied to secure communication and discuss the imperative need for physics-based key distribution schemes in pursuit of unconditional security. Concurrently, we provide a concise overview of quantum key distribution (QKD) schemes and draw comparisons with their KLJN-based counterparts. Finally, extending beyond wired communication loops, we explore the transmission of noise signals over-the-air and evaluate their potential for stealth and secure wireless communication systems.

Nonetheless, they remain the only known methods for achieving unconditional security in key exchange. Therefore, the explorations for simpler solutions for information-theoretic security are highly justified. Lin et al. [1] proposed an interesting hardware key distribution scheme that utilizes thermal-noise-free resistances and DC voltages.
  A crypto analysis of this system is presented. It is shown that, if Eve gains access to the initial shared secret at any time in the past or future, she can successfully crack all the generated keys in the past and future, even retroactively, using passively obtained and recorded voltages and currents. Therefore, the scheme is not a secure key exchanger, but it is rather a key expander with no more information entropy than the originally shared secret at the beginning.
  We also point out that the proposed defense methods against active attacks do not function when the original shared secret is compromised because then the communication cannot be efficiently authenticated. However, they do work when an unconditionally secure key exchanger is applied to enable the authenticated communication protocol.

The fluctuations of heat in particular places reflect physiological changes like bloodflow and perspiration, which can be used to remotely gauge things like anxiety and excitement. Past work in this domain has been limited to only a very limited set of architectures and techniques. This work goes further by trying a comprehensive suit of various models with different components, such as residual connections, channel and feature-wise attention, as well as the practice of ensembling components of the network to work in parallel. The best model integrated convolutional and residual layers followed by a channel-wise self-attention layer, requiring less than 100K parameters.

Heat variation of objects in thermal images can be used to overcome this. In this work, an end-to-end framework, which consists of a generative network and a detector network, is proposed to translate RGB image into Thermal ones and compare generated thermal images with real data. We have collected images from two different locations using the Parrot Anafi Thermal drone. After that, we created a two-stream network, preprocessed, augmented, the image data, and trained the generator and discriminator models from scratch. The findings demonstrate that it is feasible to translate RGB training data to thermal data using GAN. As a result, thermal data can now be produced more quickly and affordably, which is useful for security and surveillance applications.

While the fundamental ideas behind these models come from non-equilibrium physics, variational inference and stochastic calculus, in this paper we show that many aspects of these models can be understood using the tools of equilibrium statistical mechanics. Using this reformulation, we show that generative diffusion models undergo second-order phase transitions corresponding to symmetry breaking phenomena. We show that these phase-transitions are always in a mean-field universality class, as they are the result of a self-consistency condition in the generative dynamics. We argue that the critical instability that arises from the phase transitions lies at the heart of their generative capabilities, which are characterized by a set of mean-field critical exponents. Finally, we show that the dynamic equation of the generative process can be interpreted as a stochastic adiabatic transformation that minimizes the free energy while keeping the system in thermal equilibrium.

In literature, several Si-fabrication based impingement coolers with nozzle diameters of a few distributed returns or combination of micro-channels and impingement nozzles. The drawback of this Si processing of the cooler is the high fabrication cost. Other fabrication methods for nozzle diameters for ceramic and metal. Low cost fabrication methods, including injection molding and 3D printing have been introduced for much larger nozzle diameters (mm range) with larger cooler dimensions. These dimensions and processes are however not compatible with the chip packaging process flow. This PhD focuses on the modeling, design, fabrication and characterization of a micro-scale liquid impingement cooler using advanced, yet cost efficient, fabrication techniques. The main objectives are: (a) development of a modeling methodology to optimize the cooler geometry; (b) exploring low cost fabrication methods for the package level impingement jet cooler; (c) experimental thermal and hydraulic characterization and analysis of the fabricated coolers; (d) applying the direct impingement jet cooling solutions to different applications.

However, correlations between process parameters, thermal profiles, and resulting microstructure in AFSD remain poorly understood. This hinders process optimization for properties. This work employs a framework combining supervised machine learning (SML) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict peak temperature distribution in AFSD from process parameters. Eight regression algorithms were implemented for SML modeling, while four PINNs leveraged governing equations for transport, wave propagation, heat transfer, and quantum mechanics. Across multiple statistical measures, ensemble techniques like gradient boosting proved superior for SML, with lowest MSE of 165.78. The integrated ML approach was also applied to classify deposition quality from process factors, with logistic regression delivering robust accuracy. By fusing data-driven learning and fundamental physics, this dual methodology provides comprehensive insights into tailoring microstructure through thermal management in AFSD. The work demonstrates the power of bridging statistical and physics-based modeling for elucidating AM process-property relationships.

It is demonstrated here that the error of the approximate solution to the operator-valued Riccati equation is bounded above by the approximation error of the governing semigroup, under the assumption of boundedness on the semigroup and compactness on the coefficient operators. One significant outcome of this result is the correct prediction of optimal convergence for finite element approximations of the operator-valued Riccati equations for when the governing semigroup involves parabolic, as well as hyperbolic processes. We derive the abstract theory for the time-dependent and time-independent operator-valued Riccati equations in the first part of this work. In the second part, we derive optimal error estimates for the finite element approximation of the functional gain associated with model weakly damped wave and thermal LQR control systems. These theoretical claims are then corroborated with computational evidence.

This type of breast cancer is one of the most common diseases. The method of microwave radiothermometry is a promising direction for solving this problem. The method is based on measuring internal temperature of biological tissues in microwave frequency range. Computer simulations are used to improve the quality of diagnostics. Computer models make it possible to evaluate the effect of heat release in a malignant tumor on the thermal dynamics inside the mammary gland. It is necessary to build personalized models, taking into account the individual nature of the internal structure of the mammary gland in each patient. One of the problems is the determination of biophysical characteristics of biological components. Methods for determining these characteristics using computer simulations are proposed. The coefficient of thermal conductivity and specific heat of biological tissues are determined from known temperature distributions. Finding the physical parameters for a quasihomogeneous biological tissue is the first approximation for solving this problem. The least squares method is used as a solution method. The results obtained are in good agreement with previously known exact solutions, which indicates the applicability of this method for solving this class of problems. The efficiency of using parallel technologies in solving the inverse problem is investigated and the applicability of Open MP technology is demonstrated.

Furthermore, the near proximity of electronic components makes power dissipation difficult, with the risk of not being able to control the temperature appropriately, reducing component lifetime and mission performance. To address this challenge, taking advantage of the advent of increasing intelligence on board satellites, an autonomous thermal control tool that uses deep reinforcement learning is proposed for learning the thermal control policy onboard. The tool was evaluated in a real space edge processing computer that will be used in a demonstration payload hosted in the International Space Station (ISS). The experiment results show that the proposed framework is able to learn to control the payload processing power to maintain the temperature under operational ranges, complementing traditional thermal control systems.

The framework is applied to various examples including bio-inspired hierarchical honeycomb design, carbon nanotube mechanics, and protein unfolding. In spite of the flexible nature of the model-which allows us to easily incorporate diverse materials, scales, and mechanical features-it performs well across disparate forward and inverse tasks. Based on an autoregressive attention-model, MeLM effectively represents a large multi-particle system consisting of hundreds of millions of neurons, where the interaction potentials are discovered through graph-forming self-attention mechanisms that are then used to identify relationships from emergent structures, while taking advantage of synergies discovered in the training data. We show that the model can solve complex degenerate mechanics design problems and determine novel material architectures across a range of hierarchical levels, providing an avenue for materials discovery and analysis. Looking beyond the demonstrations reported in this paper, we discuss other opportunities in applied mechanics and general considerations about the use of large language models in modeling, design, and analysis that can span a broad spectrum of material properties from mechanical, thermal, optical, to electronic.

Mammography stands as the reference technique for breast cancer screening; nevertheless, many countries still lack access to mammograms due to economic, social, and cultural issues. Latest advances in computational tools, infrared cameras and devices for bio-impedance quantification, have given a chance to emerge other reference techniques like thermography, infrared thermography, electrical impedance tomography and biomarkers found in blood tests, therefore being faster, reliable and cheaper than other methods. In the last two decades, the techniques mentioned above have been considered as parallel and extended approaches for breast cancer diagnosis, as well many authors concluded that false positives and false negatives rates are significantly reduced. Moreover, when a screening method works together with a computational technique, it generates a "computer-aided diagnosis" system. The present work aims to review the last breakthroughs about the three techniques mentioned earlier, suggested machine learning techniques to breast cancer diagnosis, thus, describing the benefits of some methods in relation with other ones, such as, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, deep and convolutional neural networks. With this, we studied several hyperparameters optimization approaches with parzen tree optimizers to improve the performance of baseline models. An exploratory data analysis for each database and a benchmark of convolutional neural networks for the database of thermal images are presented. The benchmark process, reviews image classification techniques with convolutional neural networks, like, Resnet50, NasNetmobile, InceptionResnet and Xception.

On the other hand, fulfilling the safety requirements from an exponential increase of prolific UAM systems, is extremely complicated, and requires careful consideration of a variety of issues. One of the key goals of these Unmanned Air Systems (UAS) is the requirement to support the launch and control of hundreds of thousands of these advanced drones in the air simultaneously. Given the impracticalities of training the corresponding number of expert pilots, achieving this goal can only be realized through safe operation in either fullautonomous or semi-autonomous modes. According to many recent studies, the majority of flight accidents are concentrated on the last three stages of a flight trip, which include the Initial Approach, Final Approach, and Landing Phases of an airplane trip. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel decentralized processing system for enhancing the safety factors during the critical phases of Vertical and/or Short Take-Off and Landing (V/STOL) drones. This has been achieved by adopting several processing and control algorithms such as an Open Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) integrated with a Flight Rules Unit (FRU), FIR filters, and a novel Prognostic Malfunction processing unit. After applying several optimization techniques, this novel coarse-grained Autonomous Landing Guidance Assistance System (ALGAS3) processing architecture has been optimized to achieve a maximum computational processing performance of 70.82 Giga Operations per Second (GOPS). Also, the proposed ALGAS3 system shows an ultra-low dynamic thermal power dissipation (I/O and core) of 145.4 mW which is ideal for mobile avionic systems using INTEL 5CGXFC9D6F27C7 FPGA chip.

Dividing the torque between the Electric Motor (EM) and the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) requires a suitable EMS. Batteries are vital to HEVs and significantly impact overall vehicle cost and performance. High temperature and high battery State of Charge (SOC) are the main factors that accelerate battery aging. SOC is the most critical state variable in EMS and was usually considered the only dynamic variable in previous studies. For simplicity, the battery temperature was often assumed to be constant, and the effect of EMS on temperature change was neglected. In this paper, we first apply Dynamic Programming (DP) to a PHEV without considering battery temperature variations. Then, the battery model is improved by modeling the cooling system to take into account temperature variations and show how neglecting the thermal dynamics of the battery in EMS is impractical. Finally, by integrating battery temperature as a state variable in the optimization problem, a new EMS is proposed to control battery temperature and SOC variation. Simulation results of the tested vehicle show that the proposed method controls battery charge and temperature. The proposed EMS method prevents uncontrolled fluctuations in battery temperature and reduces its deterioration rate.

Previous measurements by NMR and capillary methods of excited samples demonstrated changes of proton density by 12-15%, the surface tension up to 15.7%, which can be attributed to a non-equilibrium para-/ortho- ratio. Beside these changes, we also expect a variation of heat capacity. Experiments use a differential calorimetric approach with two devices: one with an active thermostat for diathermic measurements, another is fully passive for long-term measurements. Samples after excitation are degassed at -0.09MPa and thermally equalized in a water bath. Conducted attempts demonstrated changes in the heat capacity of experimental samples by 4.17%--5.72% measured in the transient dynamics within 60 min after excitation, which decreases to 2.08% in the steady-state dynamics 90-120 min after excitation. Additionally, we observed occurrence of thermal fluctuations at the level of 10^-3 C relative temperature on 20-40 min mesoscale dynamics and a long-term increase of such fluctuations in experimental samples. Obtained results are reproducible in both devices and are supported by previously published outcomes on four-photon scattering spectra in the range from -1.5 to 1.5 cm^-1 and electrochemical reactivity in CO2 and H2O2 pathways. Based on these results, we propose a hypothesis about ongoing spin conversion process on mesoscopic scales under weak influx of energy caused by thermal, EM or geomagnetic factors; this enables explaining electrochemical and thermal anomalies observed in long-term measurements.

Some quantities however cannot be computed by simply sampling the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure, in particular transport coefficients, which relate the current of some physical quantity of interest to the forcing needed to induce it. For instance, a temperature difference induces an energy current, the proportionality factor between these two quantities being the thermal conductivity. From an abstract point of view, transport coefficients can also be considered as some form of sensitivity analysis with respect to an added forcing to the baseline dynamics. There are various numerical techniques to estimate transport coefficients, which all suffer from large errors, in particular large statistical errors. This contribution reviews the most popular methods, namely the Green-Kubo approach where the transport coefficient is expressed as some time-integrated correlation function, and the approach based on longtime averages of the stochastic dynamics perturbed by an external driving (so-called nonequilibrium molecular dynamics). In each case, the various sources of errors are made precise, in particular the bias related to the time discretization of the underlying continuous dynamics, and the variance of the associated Monte Carlo estimators. Some recent alternative techniques to estimate transport coefficients are also discussed.

Such material systems avail circulating fluids through embedded vasculatures to accomplish the mentioned functionalities that benefit various aerospace, military, and civilian applications. Although heat transfer is a mature field, control of thermal characteristics in synthetic microvascular systems via circulating fluids is new, and a theoretical underpinning is lacking. What will benefit designers are predictive mathematical models and an in-depth qualitative understanding of vascular-based active cooling/heating. So, the central focus of this paper is to address the remarked knowledge gap. \emph{First}, we present a reduced-order model with broad applicability, allowing the inlet temperature to differ from the ambient temperature. \emph{Second}, we apply mathematical analysis tools to this reduced-order model and reveal many heat transfer properties of fluid-sequestered vascular systems. We derive point-wise properties (minimum, maximum, and comparison principles) and global properties (e.g., bounds on performance metrics such as the mean surface temperature and thermal efficiency). These newfound results deepen our understanding of active cooling/heating and propel the perfecting of thermal regulation systems.

The system under study is composed of two anisotropic and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations with nonsymmetric tensors, coupled with a Poisson equation and describes in particular semiconductor devices immersed in a magnetic field. We introduce a new scheme based on an entropy-dissipation relation and prove that the scheme admits solutions with values in admissible sets - especially, the computed densities remain positive. Moreover, we show that the discrete solutions to the scheme converge exponentially fast in time towards the associated discrete thermal equilibrium. Several numerical tests confirm our theoretical results. Up to our knowledge, this scheme is the first one able to discretise anisotropic drift-diffusion systems while preserving the bounds on the densities.

The iterative methods are based on the nonlinear projection approach and use multiple grids in photon frequency. They are formulated by the high-order RT equation on a given grid in photon frequency and low-order moment equations on a hierarchy of frequency grids. The material temperature is evaluated in the subspace of the lowest dimensionality from the MEB equation coupled to the effective grey low-order equations. The algorithms apply various multigrid cycles to visit frequency grids. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate convergence of the multigrid iterative algorithms in TRT problems with large number of photon frequency groups.

At microscopic scales the elastic structures are also subject to thermal fluctuations.  Stochastic numerical methods are developed based on multigrid which allow for the efficient computation of both the hydrodynamic interactions in the presence of walls and the thermal fluctuations.  The presented stochastic multigrid approach provides efficient real-space numerical methods for generating the required stochastic driving fields with long-range correlations consistent with statistical mechanics.   The presented approach also allows for the use of spatially adaptive meshes in resolving the hydrodynamic interactions.  Numerical results are presented which show the methods perform in practice with a computational complexity of O(N log(N)).
